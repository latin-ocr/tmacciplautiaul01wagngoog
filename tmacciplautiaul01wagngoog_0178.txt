line shows, Cure. 1 3, 55 (261) siquidem hercle milvi requam dem,
though Fleckeisen transposes there mi hercle, which is however against
the authority of the MSS.

41. circumspectatrix ‘·pry ·’about Tam-mon. —oculi emissicii ‘in-
quisitive eyes,' a phrase imitated by Tertullian de pallio 6. 3 circum-
spectu emissicii ocelli immo luminis pzmcta uerbiqimmt. Cicero would
have said cmissaoei& Plautus has a similar formation Poen. v 5, 24
tunicae demissiciae, which Horace ealls eunicae demissae Serm. 1 2, 25.

42. nam cwr = curnam. Plautus and Terence frequently change
1116 order of such compounds with nam, e. g. v. 44 we have nam qua =
'qaeccmmm and Cure. 1 1, 12 nam quo te dicam 696 ire = quonam—Euclide
answer is laeonic enough, a way of speaking very natural with an angry
man. He means ‘ you ask me why I beat you, poor wretoh—well to
give you some reason to call yourself wretchea' Much of the strength
of the passage consists in the repetition of the word misera, just as in
the next line mala malam are put close together. Plautus is very fond
of such παρηγμένα 3 he very often uses them to such an extent as to

render it quite impossible to translate their full meaning into a modern
language‚ e. g. pulcra pulcritudo Glor. 959 ‘ beautiful beauty,’ parce
parcus Aul. 312, mala malitia ib. 213, stabile stabulum ib. 231. A
line from the Trinummus (68) furnishes a good example malis te uc
uerbis multis multum obiuriqem. Other exam ples are given by Munro
on Lucr. 111 889, where he quotes a line of Spenser ‘ Poorly poor man
he lived, poorly poor man he die&

43. aetas is with the comio poets very frequently an equivalent to
uita. 'l'hus Plautus says sibi inimicus maqis quam aetati tuae = uitae
tuae, tibi, Men. 67 5. Both words occur together Amph. 11 2, l 8. in
uita atque in aetate aqunda.

45. stimulorum seqes ‘ harvest of whips,’ a phrase explained by
Nonius. Prudentius meoertiq. 258 imitates it in saying scelemm seyes
and Arnobius has the expression mimium seqes.

46. hostium is a spelling not unfrequently found in late Μ SS„ and
occasionally met with even in very good MSS„ e.g. the old Ambrosian
palimpsest has it Toi‘n. 526, and B gives it ibid. 608. The same spelling
is found in the MSS. of Varro de lingua lat. vl 92 (p. 111 M.), and in
another passage (111 34) 8 MS. at Gotha gives hostia: see Miiller p. 305.
Prof Key observes (‘ Alphabet’ p. 85) 11181 11118 aspiration appears
again in the French huissier, which 6611168 from the Latin osc-iarius.
We have an express testimony with regard to the frequent misuse of
aspiration in the dialect of uneducated people, Gellius N. A. 1111 6, 3

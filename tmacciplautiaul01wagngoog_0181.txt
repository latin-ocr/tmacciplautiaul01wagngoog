EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY. 9 1

a 'necessary and organic element in Latin poetry‚ at least so far‘as our
sources permit us to trace back its history 3 still, it was frequently em-
ployed by the oldest poets who⁸ kept close to 15110 spoken language of the
people, which is always· fond of alliteration 3 and even in the best
periods of Latin poetry it was often used as an occasional ornament.
Horace eg. uses it very judiciously in such passages as dulce decus od. 1
1, 2. dulce et decorum 111 2, 13. dulce docta 111 9, 10. dulci distinet
a domo 1v 5, 12 0150. See a very good essay 011 this subject 111 Lueian
Miiller’s book de re metr. poet. p. 450 ss and Mr Munro's remarks in
his edition of Lucretius 11 p. 106. For modern languages see Marsh's
Lectures on the Enqlish lanquaqe (Lond. 1865) p. 393.

53. For examples of the phrase oculos ecfodere ὄφθαλμοῦς ἐξορύσ-
σειν see Aul. 187. Oapt. 111 1, 4. Prin. 463. Ter. Eun. IV 6, 2,
where Donatus observes ‘femineae minae sum'

54. The phrase quid rerum qeroem will be not unfrequently met
with in Plautus ; thus we have it again Aul. 117.
= 57. Forcellini quotes 15110 expression diqitus transuersus from Cato
de re met. c. 45 and 48, and the equivalent patene diqi‘tus from Caes.
ὖ. c. 11 10. imquis transuersus occurs 111 two passages of Oicem’s, ad
Att. xnI 20 and Fam. vn 25. In the latter passage the addition of the
words quod aiunt shows the proverbial character of the expression,
which would however be perfectly evident even without this hint.

- 58. respeaeis=respeae(ee)is=respexerie: Key, L. G. ᾗ 566.
59. ‘ I’ll send you for a sohooling to the gallows‚’ Thornton. The

cross shall teach you to shut your eyes for ever, if you cannot keep
them shut for a few moments.

60. In the MS. B we find here the marginal note ‘hoc secum loqui·
tur,’ which 1s perfectly adapted to the situation.. δ

62. duim (compare v. 236 perduim v. 664) is an archaic subj. pres.
from a crude form du-, see Key, L. G. ᾗ 732. The ending im is the
same as seen in edim uelim sim. Cicero has this form in the formulas
di te perduint pro rege Deiot. 7, 21, and utimm tibi istam mentem di
inmortales duint Catil. 1 9, 22. The expression uerba dare which prm
perly means ‘to give mere words instead of deeds’ commonly assumes
the more general sense ‘to deceive?
· 63. persentiscat. s‘mell the place out, where the gold' 1s hidden.’

66. In plurimis I have kept 15110 i instead of changing it into u,
since the best MSS. give it very frequently 111 those words 111 which 15110
preceding syllable has a u or an i. It is as yet an open question
whether we are entitled to write 15110 superlative ending mnus uniformly
throughout Plautus or not.

 

67. menum: tne oenum (uuum), according to the explanation first ,

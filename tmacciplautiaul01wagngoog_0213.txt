EXEGE'I'IOAL COMMENTARY. 1 2 3

410. Ι am now dispooed to read with Lambinus and Hare atat,
perii hercle e96 miser: aperitur bacwndl, adest: it is evident how easily
aperis could be taken for aperit: the short final syllable of miser would
be allowed in the caeswra,· for eqo see Introd. p. xxv. ῃ

411. In docuit the final t should be dropt, according to Introd. p.
xxxma—The maqister is of course Euclio: see v. 405.

412. Congrio on seeing Euclio issuing from the house had taken to
his heels, and therefore Euclio shouts tene tene ‘ stop him, stop him :’ cf. ,
v. 705. For the quantity ιὲηέ ten? see Introd. p. xxvn.

413. The creauivi are the treswiri capitales whose duty it was to
take care of the prisons and to punish those whom they found trespassing
against the security of the public 3 Amph. 1 1, 3 Sosia is afraid of being
taken up by the tresuiri: quid facim nunc, si tresuiri me in eoercerem
conpeqerint7 and Asin. 1 2, 5 Argyrippus threatens the cruel mother of
his mistress to give her name to the tresuiri: ibo eqo ad Msuiros, 226⁸-

Μαρια.» ibi nemina Fdxo emm: eapitis te perdam eqo et filiam. Oomp. ⁴‘

also Persa 72 ut aequa pwrti prodeam ad miros. See Walter, r’o‘m.
rechtsqeeck. § 141.—quam obrem is the spelling adopted by Fleckeisen
throughout his edition of Terence, on the very practical purpose to show
at once that in the comic poets quam always must be elided before ob.

414. Douma proposes quid 7 quod minatu’s: and who would hesi·
tate to accept this reading if it were found in the MSS? But the au·
theuticated reading admits of a very appropriate explanation ‘ why did
you threaten me‘l' and should therefore not be solicited.

416. uiuere is frequently an equivalent for the simple esse: e. g.
Amph. proL 75 uictores uiuere. Trin. 390 lepidus uiuis ‘ you are a
jolly man.’ Men. 202 uiuis meis πιονίροτα moribus. ibid. 908 eqo
homo uiuo miser. Catullus has the same use of uiuere: 10, 34 sed tu
insulsa male ac molesta uiuis, and 111, 1 uiuere contentas uiro solo.

417. plus lubens = lubentior, as explained by Operarius. The usual
way of circumscribing the comparative would be by magis: only one
other instance of plus being known, Nemes. ecl. 4, 72: plus tamen ‘ipse
meus, plus est formosus Iolas. We may also quote the Italian pi& volen-
cieo-c· and the French plus volmztiers. Guyet and Weise write mmli,
Bothe omits plna—In lubens the final letters ns should be entirely
dropt: see Introd. p. mlv.

419. mollior mayie: to strengthen a comparative by adding maqis
or maye seems to have been quite familiar to the conventional language
of the Romans: comp. M en. prol. 55 maqis madores naqa-s eqerit. Stich.
698 Ιιοσ maqis est dulcius. Capt. 111 4, 111 nihil inuenies Μαρία hoc
certo certius. Poen. 11 15 amentiores maye emmt atque wezzi minus.
Among prose-writers, constructione of this kind occur only in Va·-

98 mennon, commum.

observes ‘profectus dicitur etiam de eo qui incipit proficisci! This ex-
plains such expressions as prefectu 's ire Rud. 111 6, 9 and hinc profecbust
ire Trin. 149, as the last editor has happily emended—postulem (⁶ di-
rectly afterwards') occurs only in this passage 3 I have kept it on the
authority of my MSS. and three of Gruter’s Patavini. Compare the
analogous formation indidem.

119. quantum potero tanatum recipiam ‘ I shall come back as quick
as possible.’ Ter. Ad. 111 2, 62 tu quamtum potes abi, where Fleckeisen
adopts Guyet’s emendation potest. It is true that in this phrase either
the best or at least good MSS. give potest as an impersonal in Ter. Ad..v
7, 11. Phorm. v 8, 3. 1v 3, 69. Ad. lv 5, 665 but Andr. v 2, 20 and
Ad. 111 2, 52 potes alone is recorded 88 the reading of the MSS. It
should therefore not have been changed into potesa- moreover‚ this line
of the Aulularia proves that in this phrase the verb could be persona-l
88 well as impersonal: a fact which appears also from Capt. 11 3, 88 ut
quam primum possis redeas, where Brix compares Ter. Andr. 111 3, 45

quemcum quemn and Eun. v 2, 5 quantum queo·

120. ” Τ118 forms med and ted are used by Plautus both in the accus.
and abl. sing. See Key, L. G. ξ 281. 284. ’1)1. Umpfenbach‚ in his
‘ Meletemata Plautina,' attempta to show that med and ted can only be
ablatives, and corrects therefore all passages in which the MSS. give
these forms 88 accusatives. In this line he writes arbitrarier me, but
‘ paenultimam (-ri-) uocis arbiorarier correptam constanter usurparI, non
productam, pueruli sciunt.’ (G. Studemund, de canticis Plautinis p. 44).

122. ut aequomst sc. facere. The infinitive in such constructions
is sometimes omitted and aequomst seemingly assumes the same con-
struction as decet. Oomp. Rud. 47 is leuc, uc se aequomst, flocci nou

fecit fidem. It was therefore a happy thought of Brix to add me v.
421 and Capt. 995 eheu, quom eqo plus minusque feci quam me aequem
fuit (the MSS. omit me, Lindemann and Fleckeisen add illi).

124. multum has here an adverbia} sense, comp. Stich. 206 multum
miseri. Examples of this use from Horace are generally known: ep. 1
10, 3 multum dissimiles. serm. 11 5, 92 multum similis and others.
multiloquaces‚ the word proposed for this line by Passerat‚ has for itself
the authority of an old glossary, but cannot be admitted on account of

11ἑῖ metre. Plautus has the word multilocus Cistell. 1 3, 1 and Pseud.

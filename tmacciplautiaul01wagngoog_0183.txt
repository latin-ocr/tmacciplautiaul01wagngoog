77 s. Famianus Strada has written a special paper on this littera
Ζοηρα, but the right explanation has been found out by Lipsius who
‘ compares an epigram of Ausonius (128, 10): Quid, inperite, P putas ibi
scriptwm, ubi locem: iota conuenit longum 7 This epigram is directed
against Ennus, a man of very bad repute, wh0, as the poet insinuates,
ought to be sent to the gallows. The figure of a long I is indeed some-
what like the appearance of a hanging body, especially if that body
should be very 111111 and slender. lonqae litterae are also mentioned
Eud. v 2, 7 and Poen. 1v 2, 15, but without any special reference to the
letter I: comp. littera pensilis Pseud. 17.—unam is not pleonastic, as
Weise says (800 11010 011 v. 563); Staphyla intends making of herself
one long letter 3 i. e. a letter exhibiting one long stroke.

’ἴ 9. animo defaecato is explained by Camerarius ‘ liquido minimeque
turbido, i. e. hilari ς’ 800 Pseud. 7 60 nunc liquet, nunc defaecatumt cor
mihi. The same meaning is expressed by animo liquido et tranquillo ee
Epid. v 1, 36 and liquido es antimo Pseud. 232. In 0110 passage (Most.
158) 1110 word defaecatus is metaphorically used of a person cleaned by
a bath.

81. nunciam: ‘in Plautus and Terence the i of iam must always
be pronounced as a pure vowel when following nunc ,⁸ this shows that
nunciam is actually one word just as well as etiam quoniam uspiam, and
sometimes we find nunciam written together in the MSS. (Tm‘n. 195.
Pseud. 546 [Men.1155]).’ Brix on Trin. 3.—quippini, instead of
wippeni, is very frequently given by the best MSS„ e. g. M ost. 948.
1109. Pseud. 361. The final ἔ 111 quippe was changed into i before an
n, in the same way as we have tutin = tutem: see Corssen, ausepr. 1,
27 2. The right punctuation of this passage is first seen in Pareus’
edition, and is here of much importance for the construction of the
sentence. The sense is ‘ why should Ι 11012 Shall I really take care of
all within? Perhaps you are afraid, somebody should run away with
· our house ‘l’ ‘

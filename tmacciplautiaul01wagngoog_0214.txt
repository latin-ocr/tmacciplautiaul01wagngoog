lerius Maximus, J ustinus, Arnobius and Boethius, In Greek μᾶλλον
is frequently added to comparativae, even by the best writers. see Krii-

ger‚ qriechisclzc spraohlehre § 49, 7, 5. But it would be quite perverse
to say that the Latin constructions were imitatione of the Greek· , for the

very fact that we find them only in the comics or in later and negligent
writers, would speak against such a theory. The vulgar dialects of the
English language are not free from the same pleonastic comparative, e. g.
Dickens lets a carter say that his beer‘ is more flatterer than it miqlac
be? Old Curiosity Shop chapt. 26 (p. 121 people' s edition). In may-is
the final s should be dropt. —cimedus means a public dancer of a rather
loose character: see Geor„ 668 twm ad mumdum non cinaedus malacus
aequest atque eqo. For the expression mollis flactibus Hare justly com-
pares Glor. 1424 mitis swm equidem fustibus.

420. The construction tibi noe tactiost is explained by Key, L. G.
§ 907 and 1302. We have the same v. 737. Cure. v 2, 27 (= 626 FL).
Cae. 11 6, 54. Poen. v 5, 29. Men. 1016, and in the same way we read
quid tibi hunc receptio ad test mcum uirum Asin. v 2, 70 (= 920), and
quid tibi huc wentiost? quid tibi hano aditiosm quid tibi Iumc notioet,
inquam, amicam mam? Truc. 11 7, 62 ss. (= 611 s. Geppert).—-I should
not *have written rest, but have kept the reading of my good MSS. res.
quae res is a phrase expressing indignation and surprise = quae ista tcm-
dem res est. Thus we have Asin. 11 4, 71 (-- 477) quae res? tun libero
homini male seruos loquere? For other instances see Poen. v 4, 29.
Οαε. 11 8, 18. 111 6, 8.

421. With roqitae comp. v. 337.—F0r the construction of the words
quam me aequom erat see note on v. 122.-In erat the final t should be
dropt: in the same way we must pronounce capu in the following line.

422. sine appears almost as a threatening interjection in several
passages in Plautus and Terence: e. g. Hec. Π 4, 85 where Donatus ob-
serves ‘ sine separatim accipe, quia uim habet conminantis.’ See also
Eun. 1 1, 20. Plaut. Aa v 2, 4B.—To improve the metre of the line,
it would be better to adopt the transposition suggested by Hare and
G. Hermann: see crit. note.-The commentators observe that the an-
cients used to direct their blows against the head: see Hor. sem 1 5,
22. Amph„ 1 1, 162 Mercurius says of his fist that it exossat os homi-
nibus. Oomp. also v. 437 ‘nonfissilc hoc haberes caput and 451. Congrio
means si hoc (i. e. meum) caput sentit in the sense of ‘ si quid ego sapio,
si quid in me sensus est,’ as Lambinus justly explains it ς for caput fre-
quently signifies the entire person, e. g. Ter. Andr. 11 2, 34. Ad. 11 3, 8.
Verg. Aen. 1v 345, and instances of sentio in the sense of ‘sapere‘ are
given by the dictionaries. Euclio ironically replies ‘ tuom nunc caput
cemit’ by which he alludes to the blows inflicted upon Congrio's head.

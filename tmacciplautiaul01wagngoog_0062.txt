xlviii mraoouo'mon.

The two genitivos eius and huius are occasionally ahoi-bened in their
first syllable, when standing after a short accented syllable¹:

ut sibi eius faciat copiam. illa enim se negat
Ter. Phorm. 1 2, 63.

si quid huius simile forte aliquando euenerit
‘ Ter. Haut. tim. 111 2, 20.

Mr Parry gives in the first instance eibi ut eius, while he preserves
the reading of the MSS. in the second passage, where it would have
been just as easy to transpose si Inpius quid. But there is no note on
either passage to enlighten the reader about such a surprising incon-
sistency.

- To this shortened quantity in the genitive wemay add an instance
in which the dative huic has the metrical value of a short syllable: Ter.
Ad.1v5‚4(=638F1„):   α

quid huic hio negotist? tsmo has pepulisti foris ²

- This· is, as far as I can see, the reading of all MSS· and editions, but
no editor has a note on the shortene'd quantity of huic. Guyet alone

(comm. p. 244) proposes to write quid hic huic.
Th'e word auc appears shortened Bacch. 491, where Fleckeisen gives
in accordance with all the MSS. as follows:

satin ut quem tu habete fidelem tibi aut quoi eredas nescias?

Bitschl admits a hiatus, omits tu and transposes tibifidelem.

Even the shortening of the first syllable in audiui would have to be
assumed, if the reading of a line in the Truculentus (1 2, 92= 126 G.)
were safely established. In this passage the MSS. give

peperisse eam audiui :z ah, obsecro, tace Diniarche 2: quid iam

But, according to 'Geppert's testimony, the old Ambrosian palim-
psest omits emm, so that the line would be unobjectionable. It is, how-
ever, not impossible that the omission of eam is due to the metrical
correction of some ancient grammarian whose authority was followed by

the scribe of the MS.
2. We shall now mention some instances where the usual rules of

position have to yield to the rhythmical influence of the accent. Thus

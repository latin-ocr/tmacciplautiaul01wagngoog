Such a hypothesis would not, however, be supported by any historical

documenta
503. pulcrumst is of course ironical: but there seems to exist

no other passage with the same turn of expression—Of the particle
praequam I cannot find more than five instances in Plautus: this line,
Mero. 23. Most. 982. 1146 and Amph. 11 2, 3 3 it does not occur in
Terence and the fragments of the other comic writers, but in later
times Gellius uses it again xvl 1. In the same way Plautus has the
particle praeut.- Amph. 1 1, 218. 'Men 376. 935. Glor. 20. Bacch. 929.
M erc. 470. Ritschl and Fleckeisen write prae quemn in two words, and

should consequently also write prae ut which they do not.
504. On the hiatus in this line, see Introd. p. Lx11.-The word

linwius occurs only here in Plautus, but is also quoted from an inscrip-
tion, Gruter p. 649, 3. ’

505. caupones ‘ retail-dealels.’ ‘pataqiwm’ esc quod ad swnmam
tunicam assui solet, quae et patayiata (Epid. 11 2, 47) dicitur, et ‘pata-
9iarii’ qui eiusmodi opera faciunt. Festus: the word pataqiarius is
however a ἅπ. λεγ.-Οι11· MSS. give here indusiarii, and indus-iatam
Epid. 11 2, 47 : but Varro derives the word from· incus de l. 1. v 131 p.
5 l M. and accordingly writes incusium, and from this source Nonius
derives his knowledge p. 539, 31 ‘indusium est uestimentum, quod corpori
intra plurimas uestes adhaeret, quasi intusium. Plautus in Epidico’
etc. p. 542, 22 he quotes from Varro de uita pop. Rom. 1 (=p. 237 ed.
Bip.) ‘posteaquam binas tunicae habere coeperunt, instituerunt uocare
subuculam et indussam (thus the MSS) The adjective indusiatus occurs
in Appuleius and the verb indusioere' in Martianus Capella. On the in-
dusimn itself, Bottiger (Sabina 2, 113 sec. ed.) has the following remarks.
‘The shirt was a kind of under—tunic (interula) made either of linen
(lima, Salm. ad scr. h. a. 1 972) or of cotton (byssinae). It was worn
by both sexes: for men it was called subucula, for women intusium
(Ferrar. de re uest. 3, 1 p. 175), precisely as the English distinguish
between shirt and shift. The neglige or morning-dress of ladies in-
doors consisted, as we see from many passages in Ovid and PropertiuS, in
nothing but such a shirt which when fitting very tightly, did not even
require to be fastened by a belt . . but as it might easily become very
troublesome on account of its length, it was generally kept together by
a semia-ona, at least until the proper tunica was thrown over it.’

506. cmm-ius occurs only here: ceo-aria stands in the MSS. Glor.
694, where the reading seems however very uncertain. Comp. Ou.

507. linteo ‘a linen-weaver’ occurs here, in Servius on Aen. v11 14,

and an inscription Gruter p. 38, 15.—-calceolasriu3 ‘ a shoessmaker,’ ἅπ. λεγ.

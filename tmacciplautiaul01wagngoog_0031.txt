voc. a is constantly long. We ffnd it long again in some lines of Livius
Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius (Anu. 148. 484. 319. 433. 305 ed.

Vahlen), and in a hexameter in the sepulchral inscription which
Plautus is said to have composed for himself:

scaenast desei-td: dein Risus Ludus Iocusque. ’

It is therefore ΒΥ no means surprising to find that Plautus uses the
same quantity in several passages of his comedies. This fact had al-
ready been acknowledged ΒΥ Lindemann in Prin. 11 1, 28¹, and in
about a dozen passages ΒΥ Weise ⁹2 but it was again rejected ΒΥ Ritschl.
Nevertheless, Prof. ΚΘΥ was right not to be daunted in statin g the fact
Lat. Gram. § 88 p. 13 (5 ed). Oorssen gives three instances of it in ,
Plautus (ausspr. 1, 330): Fleckeisen has 18 in his excellent paper on
this subject ⁸, but there probably are still more to ΒΘ discovered. One
has been added in the present edition of the Aulularia, v. 135.

us in the nom. of the second declension is occasionally found long in
Naevius ε

dein pollens sagittis inclutas arquitenens
sanctus Delphis prognatus Putias Apollo ⁴.

There are, however, no instances of this quantity to be met with in
Plautus, at least so far as our present knowledge goes 3 but he uses

sometimes

ὂῑῖθ (dat. and abl. plur.) as a long syllables see Aul. 376. Mero. 919.
Most. 1118. M m. 842. The same quantity appears in virgil, Aen. 1v 64⁶.
The ending or in nouns of the third declension is frequently long.
That it was originally long, might be concluded from the genitive oris

and from a comparison with the Greek ωρ. Thus we have sorb'r Poen.

² De prosodia Plauti p. x in his second edition of the Captiui‚ Miles glo-
riosus and Trinummus, Lipsiae 1844. The last editor of the Trinmmus, Mr
Brix, gives the passage in question in accordance with Lindemann, though he seems
unaware of this precedence. The instance which Μι- Brix quotes from Ter. Hec.
prol. 2 is very doubtful.

² See his index in his edition of Plautus, Quedlinburg 1838. Weise is one of
those unfortunate editors whose books are much used and little praised: but his
index is really praiseworthy.

ences always apply to the readings of the MSS„ which are however generally
altered by Bitschl.

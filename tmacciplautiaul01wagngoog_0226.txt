Mercklin (ind. schol. Dorpat. 1862 p. 1111) compares Glor. 52 and Cure.

547. Appuleius Metam. 11 p. 57 ed. Delph. manifestly imitates this
passage in describing a restlesS, suspicions fellow who priae into every-
thing: uides hominem insomnem, certe perspicaciorem ipso Iasnceo wel
Arqo, et oculeum totwm.

548. For custodem addere comp. Glor. 146. 298. 305 (where the
MSS. read tradidit, but Bitschl rightly gives addidit from Douza's con-
jecture) and' G'apt. 111 5, 50. Lambinus quotes the same expression
from Hor. od. 111 4, 78.

550. For interbibere see Donatus as quoted in the critical note and
Key, L. G. ξ 1342, 1 -d.—scatat, not from scatere, but scatere.- this infini-
tive occurs in a fragment of an unknown tragic poet quoted by Cic.
Tusc. 1 28, 69 (Ribb. trag. p. 217) and three times in Lucretiug who
has also scatit, see Munro on v 40.

551. The older Roman poets always change Greek names and words
to the appearance of Latin forms, and accordingly give them Latin ter-
minations. The forms Oresten Echion Salamiua as found in Ennius
and Pacuvius are solitary exceptions. The introduction of pure Greek
forms is one of the characteristic features of the Augustan period. See
Corssen‚ auespr. 2, 227-233.

552. Hildyard appropriately compares Massinger, City Madam 1 1
provision enouqh to serve a qam-ison.

554. Appuleius imitatas this passage in calling a fat lamb aquus
incuriosus Flor. 2. Some editors read curionem on account of the fol-
lowing line, but this reason is not at all cogent: Megadorus tries to
make a joke in giving Euclio's ill-natured remarks another turn3 he does
not however succeed, as Euclio imparts to cario too the sense of care-
worn. All these significations are of course purposely moulded for this
sole passage: Pseud. 1143 (which Hildyard quotes) Ritschl's edition
gives caue eis a curuo infortunio on the authority of the palimpsest.

55 6. comp. ossa atque pellis sum miser aeqritudine ‘ only skin and
bones' Capt. 1 2, 32. The expression appears to be proverbial: comp.
Theoor. 11 89 αὐτὰ δὲ λοιπὰ ὅστῖ ἔτ’ ἦς καὶ δέρμα. Horace has a similar
expression ossa pelle amicta lurida epod. 17, 22.

557. For the reading of the line see p. Lxxl.

558. Ι have kept the form lantema as given by the MS. B:
in the only other two passages where this word occurs in Plautus,
Amph. prol. 149 and ib. 1 1, 249, B has laterna, and in J the lines in
question are illegible. In the line from the prologue to the Amphitruo
I should propose to read a portu illice mim cum laterna aduenit (illic B)-

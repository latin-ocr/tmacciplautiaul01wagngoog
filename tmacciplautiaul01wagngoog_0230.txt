579. facinus would in prose be generally omitted ; translate ‘it
behoves a good servant.'—From Cicero Tusc. 111 8, 16 we leam that the
Greek forfruqi would be χρήσιμος, and the same tells us that hominem
fraqi omnia recte facere, ihm powerbi locum obvinet ib. 1v 16, 36.

581. cx sententia ‘ to his satisfaction' for the phrase see Pan-y on
Ter. Haut. tim. 1v 3, 5.—postulat = uolt, see on 359.

582. Oomp. Verg. Aen. 1 80 iussa capessere fas est. Plaut. Tria.
299 capesses mea inperia.

584-590. After I had first observed (de Aul. p. 29) that the
reading of these lines could not be genuine, and had thought of
transposing 591-594 after 583, Brix (jahrb. 1865 p. 56) pointed out
that the lines which I have now secluded from the text, were but
a parallel passage originally written on the margin of the archetype of
our MSS. and did not therefore belong to the Aulularia. For, as he
judiciously says, we can only understand them of an amor meretricias,
in which case it would indeed be the duty of a faithful servant to
restrain his master: but in the present case Lyconides is bent on lawful
marriage without being very deeply in love, and as he does not doubt
of Euclio's consent (which appears from lv 10), it would be a super·
fluous presumption of his slave to attempt to keep him back (retinere
ad salutem). Such parallel passages have sometimes been added in the
MSS. of the Plautian comedies, e. g. M en. 984 a passage from the com-
mencement of the fourth act of the Mostellaria.

584. For ero see Introd. p. xxn—seruitutem seruire occurs several
times in Plautus, once even in Cicero Mur. 29, 61. Oomp. note on
facinus facere 218.

586. For non enim Ι have conjectured noenwm in my note on 67.
——For immutat see Introd. p. xvm.

589. For modo see Introd. p. xxn.

590. tolerem-e has here the sense of matteum-e, as Tria. 338. 358.
371. .
591. The ῖ in erae is here shortened in consequence of the accent
being thrown on the first short syllable: this instance should be added
to those collected Introd. p. xnvn a—frons eri, oculi serui: an atten-
tive slave should understand to read his master’s looks. The expression

. was no doubt proverbial like the German ‘ er siche dir daim wamel& am

yesichtc ab?

592. citis quadrifis citius: comp. Poen- 1 2, 156 quodq-{qis cuv-aim
ad cmuflcem rapi, and Asin. 11 2, 13 ‚tamquam edepol quadn‘qis albis
adipiscas postem—Plautus has persequor here and 579: Ter. H aut. tim.
Ν 1, 22 says inperium exequi.

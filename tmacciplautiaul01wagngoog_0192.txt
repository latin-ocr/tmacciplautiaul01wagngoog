1 Ο 2 · EXEGETIGAL COMMENTARY.

about Nothing 11 4 ‘She speaks portiom-ds, and every word παῦε] The
contrary is expressed- by Aristophanes Nub. 910 ῥόδα μ’ εἴρηκας.

154. perendie ‘the day afterz’ this is the original meaning of this
word which will thus be constantly met with in Plautus. Comp. the
phrase used in the leqis actiones ‘in diem tertium siue perendinum’
(see Bergk, rhein. mus. xtx 606) and Mero. 378 crae aqito, perendie
affice. Megadorus seems to have the same opinion of married life which
Hipponax expresses in the following lines δύ’ ἡμέραι γυναικός εἰσιν
ἥδισταί, Ὅταν γαμῇ τις κᾶκφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν. Another sentence of the same
kind is reported of Chaeremon γυναῖκα θάπτειν κρεῖσσόν ε’στιν ἦ γαμεῖν.
[The comma after perendie is due to the printer‚ not the editor]

157. The reading of this line is not quite settled. In the reading
adopted in our text we have the final syllable in qrandior long (see
Introd. p. XVIII) and the last syllable in mulieris as anceps, which in
the caesura may be exeused. I am now inclined to read sed ee yrcindior
nam, mediast mulieris aetas.- where the short quantity of es would have
to be added to the similar instanees enumerated Introd. p. mmm—aetas
medica i. e. inter senem inveneritque, sed proprior seni, as Seneca expresses
it Oed. 776. Cicero has media aetas de sen. 17, 60 and 20, 76.

159. neuis] Comp. neuelles v. 284 and see Key, L. G. ξ 734.

161. Megadorus eontemptuously calls a wife of somewhat maturer
years anus, to express that she is nearly old enough to deserve this title.
The epithets senex and anus are, however, not to be taken as expres-
sions of a very old age, they being sometimes applied to persons of about
45 to 50 years. Ε. g. Amphitruo is called senex in the eomedy bearing
his name v 1, 20. 1v 2, 12, though he seems a newly-married man ‘in
the prime of his years’

162. postwmus is a formation of the same kind as infamas intumus
extamus.- see Key, L. G. ξ 823. It generally means a son born after
his father's death, but sometimes even sons born when their fathers
were very old were called se. See virgil, Aen. V1 763 Siluius,
Albanum nomen, tua postuma proles, Quem tibi lonyaem serum Lauinia
coniunx Educet siluis. Gellius gives us the note of an ancient gram-
marian, Caesellius, on this passage ‘ postuma proles non eum eiymfleac
qui patre ωοτιτιο, sed qui postremo loeo natus est. sicuti Siluius qui
Aenea imm sene tardo seroque partu est editus! Noct. att. 11 16 with
Gronovius' note. ’

163. deyam„ the reading found in Nonius, eould be defended by
Epid. 1 1, 63 deqetur coriwm de ter-90 meo, where Β and the Palatino
MSS. give demetur, while Nonius has deqetur. It is however much
more probable that Plautus himself wrote demam et deminuam: see
note on v. 49. It is now evident by the express testimony of Schwarz·

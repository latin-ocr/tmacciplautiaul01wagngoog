4, 41 Iuno Lucina, ser opem, serua me, obsecro with the commentators
and Preller, ro‘m. myth.. p. 243. Donatus observes on the line in the
Andria ‘nota hoc uersu totidem uerbis uti omnes puerperas in comoediis,
nec alias [perhaps nec ullas] induci loqui in proscaenio: nam haec uox
post scaenam totlitur.’—tuam fidem sc. rogo, inploro: comp. erc. 196 and
the title of Varro's satire Herculea tuam fidem p. 283 in the Bipontine
edition. For uestramfidem see Westerhov on Ter. Andr. 1v 3, 1, where
Donatus observes that in these elliptic expressions fidem means ‘ opem et .
auxilium!

685. rem potiorem uideo uerbis. Why shall I tell you of it any
longer‘l my words are quite superfluous, since the fact speaks for itselfi—
For tibi see Key, L. G. § 978.

688. Strobilum miror ubi eit: prolepsis for miror ubi Strobi-
lus sit.

691. iniurium is an archaic word which was· in later times replaced
by the adj. inin-somn or the subst. ‘iniuria It occurs oisc. 1 1, 105. Ter.
Ad. 1 2, 26 and 11 1, 51. Hec. 11 1, 14. iniurius stands Arubr. 11 3, 3.
Hauc. tim. 11 3, 79. Cure. 65. Epid. lv 1, 24. Rud. 1152.

692. The simile is easily understood. Oomp. Pseud. 1232 and
Truc. 1v 3, 45 (=807 Geppert) where the word comitia is used in a
similar way. See also v. 541.

693. ’Ἔφη Ἀριστέης...ὖπὲρ Ἀριμασπῶν...οἰκεῖν τούς χρυσοφύλακας
γρῦπας Her. 1v 13 who mentions the same γρῦπας 111 116 and 1v 27.
According to Nonius (see crit. note) we should here find a translation
of this Greek or rather Oriental (Preller, qriech.. myth. 1, 158 first ed.)
sable3 but as the picus (i. e. the woodpecker) holds a marked position in
old Italian mythology, and was believed to know of hidden treasures
(Pi-oller, rom. myth.. p. 298), we are rather inclined to think that Plautus
mixed the Greek qrypes and the tales told of their golden treasures with
the common beliefs which were current among his own countrymen with
regard to the woodpecker. The aurei montes of the pici appear only in
this one passage. I may venture to lead the attention of my readers to
another passage in Plautus, without drawing myself any hasty conclu-
sion from it: Stich. 24 Persarum montis qui 6666 awrei perhibentur, a
passage which may be compared with some lines from Varro’s satire
Ἀνθρωπουργία (p. 264 ed. Bip.) Persarum montes, ‘non cimicis atm'a Crassi.
—The form Vites as found in J seems due to a misapprehension of the
archaic nom. plur. Picis which is preserved in By (see Introd. p. xxx.)
and which I might have put into the text. It is true we should expect
the accus. Picos, but the nom. must be explained by supposing the same
kind of atti-action which we have noticed on v. 566. Oomp. moreover

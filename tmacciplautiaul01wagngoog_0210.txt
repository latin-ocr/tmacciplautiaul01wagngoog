1 20 EXEGETIOAI. COMMENTARY.

the line such as it actually appears in the MSS. cui in re talia (Le. tali
ima) subuertit antidkac: does it not look like an explanatory note added
by a grammarian ‘ this god in former times helped people in such dis-
tress as this’2 The present metrical form is apparently due to the cor-
rections of scribeS.—antidhae is in fact the same as mehae which is
the reading found in J and all the late MSS„ except in γ, and even there
antidhae is written by the second hand, while the first hand had mttehac.
ΤΙιθ fun form of the preposition ante was cmtid or anted (comp. postici
prod red): Corssen, ausspr. 1, 337. Prof. Key holds that hac in antehae
posthac praeterhac is a corrupted form of an original accusative (L. G.
ξ 802): in the same way we should have postilla praeterea antea etc.
with the loss of a final m,· the gender would be accounted for by an
ellipsis of rem. Of course, Prof. Key would hold the same opinion with
regard to adeo, where we should thus have an original accusative
eom. But first of all, the long quantity of the final a in praeterea
etc. or the ὃ in adeo would be left unexplained. On the other hand,
it is a well attested fact that in. the oldest period of the Latin language
the use of the cases after certain prepositions was far from being fixed
and uniform. To quote an instance from the senatusc. de Bac„ we have
there aduersum ead: where ead cannot be an accusative, as vulgar igno-
rance would conjecture 3 in the case of the prepositions sub and subter
the language always remained in a fluctuating state ; with regard to in
it is known that the best Latin writers sometimes have in mentem est
and similar constructione. Why should we not therefore regard antehac
praeterhac antea praeterea etc. as real ablativesl See also Corssen‚
ausspr. 2, 266. .

. 393. For saquis see Introd. p. XLIV. This pronunciation had
already been suggested by Hare in his ms. notes, where he compares

· Prin. 7 25.—What is meant by fures thensaurarii‚ is clear enough 3 but

thesaurarius appears a ἅπαξ λεγ.
396. With this line a passage from Ter. Ad. 111 3, 23 ss. is gene·
rally compared. From reminiscences of this and other passages of the

” same kind the old dittography may have arisen which we here find in

all our MSS. The word exdorsuare occurs only here and in Appuleius,
-Perhaps the reading attested by the MSS. of Nonius, potes, should be

kept: see note on v. 119.

397. In our text the misprint ‘tuendam should be corrected in zue-n-
dam. For the explanation of the passage see Pliny as quoted in tho
critical notes. piscor in Plautian language always means ‘ a miner, ’
never ‘a baker’: see a passage from Varro de uita p. r. quoted b'y

Nonius p. 152⁶ nee pistoris nomen erat nisi eius qui rum far pin-seba&
To bake bread was therefore one of the duties of hired cooks.

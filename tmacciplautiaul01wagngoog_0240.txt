1 50 EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY.

7 30. Throughout the following passage the joke consists in the'
regular misunderstanding of the fem. pronouns, which Euclio refers to his
wala, while Lyconides thinks he speaks of 1116 daughter.—For fuit see
Introd. p. xlx.

731. Τ116 expression culpam commeritum justifies Brix’s correction
of v. 728. Oomp. Cape. 11 3, 43 (= 400).

733. tosnqere is very frequently used in the sense of corrumpere
filiam, ag. Hor. serm. 1 2, 54 matronam nullam eqo ιαηρο. Τ11116 we
have tactio v. 737 with the same ambiguity. Comp. a similar passage
Pseud. 120 and 121 and the examples given by Westerhov on Ter.
Ewn. 11 3, 81.

7 34. ‘factwm infectum fieri non potest' is a principle of common
661166 and was therefore received among the maxims of Roman law.
Oomp. Tryphonius 1. 12 ξ 2 D. de captiuis (49, 15) ‘facti coeusae infactas
nulla constitutione fieri possunt? Pomponius 1. 2 D. de rescind. uend.
(18, 5) ‘ potest, dum ree inteqra est, conuentione nostra iqfhctafieri emtio. . .
post pretium sobatmsm injectam emtionem facere mn possmus? We
. have the same phrase Ter. Phorm. v 9, 44 6. and Plaut. Tmo. 1v 2, 17.

736. ‘ Neruam adpellamus ferreum uinculum quo pedes inpediun-
tur.' Festus. Oomp. erc. v 3, 11. The instrument was about the
same as the ‘ stocks’ formerly in use in Eugland.—Acidalius reads ob te
me and seems therefore to take neruus -111 the more general sense of
‘ prison,’ which it sometimes has in Plautus (see Parry on Ter. Phorm. 11
2, 11).

738. Oomp. Ter. Ad. 111 4, 24 persuasit nox aanor wiwam adules-
centia, where Westerhov quotes Ovid, Amor. 1 6, 59 ‘nox et aanor uinum-
que nihil moderabile suadent. See 788.

740. Τ116 construction itself shows that we should write sit instead
of est, though the indicative 16 given by all our MSS. We may com-
pare another Plautian passage, M erc. v 4, 24 s. (-- 985 R.) natm ei istuc
ius sit, senecta aetate scortum: patres, Vbi loci siet res summa puplica?
where all the MSS. and old editions give est, but Ritschl justly writes
sit. I ought to have done the same in the present line of the Aulularia.
eit would then have its original long quantity: 666 p. XX.

741. Ι11 this line we are indebted to Nonius for preserving the
genuine phrase luci clamo, which is generally obliterated in our MSS.

Oomp. Ter. Ad. v 3, 55 cum pnlmo luci, where the Bembinus has primo
baeu and pm‘ana luce is found in recent MSS. (see Bentley's note): Dona.-
tus, whose notes are here interpolated, has however a genuine remark on
’ this passage ‘ ueteres masculbno yenere dieebemt lucem.'—Plaut. oisc. 11 1,
48 B gives quom primo luci and the MSS. of Nonius give the same
phrase in a line of Atta 468, 32 = Ribb. com. p. 138. But in oio. off

EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY. '1 1'1

197. Corssen, ausapr. 2, 80. Euclio is going to say istuc de dote mmi-
nem's scito (see v. 255), but Megadorus cuts him short off by saying flet.
In the same way a delicate pecuniary arrangement is indicated by a
simple Ῐιαεε Trin. 578.

262. propere strenue express together only one notion‘ directly)

264. in in the compound inaudire denotes privacy ‘to hear as a
secret,' see Key, L. G. ἕ 1338 8.

265. id] It would be possible to understand thensaurum as a neuter}
see note on v. 10. Still it is much more probable that id here represents
the general notion of the thing ‘ that’s what he is after? So we have eo
in reference to quadraqinta minae Tria. 405. Oomp. As. 1 1, 7 6 uiqinti
iam usust filio arqenti minis .· Face id ut paratwm iam sia—obsti-
nare is explained by Festus to be ‘ affirmato et perseueranti animo
expetere.’ It occurs thus only here in Plautus.

266. deblaterare is an intension of the simple verb blaterare used by
Horace (serm 11 7, 35) and some older poets, e. g. Afranius and Caecilius
(Nonius p. 78, 30). Plautus has blatire Amph. 11 l‘, 71. Epid. 111 1,
13. Ourc. 111 82. 888 Gellius 1 15, where a whole chapter is devoted
to loquacity. The German plappern and the English to blab are derived
from the medieval form blaberare. —F or de· in composition with verbs
see Key, L. G. ξ 1327.

267. The Future Infinitive 1s one of the cases in which the auxiliary
may be omitted even in Plautus, see Key, L. G. ξ 1259.-—Oomp. Cure.
v 3, 8 heus tu, lenc, te uolo. It is not impossible that molo 18 likewise
the true reading in this passage, although uoco gives a good sense and 18,
moreover, the reading of the MSS.

268. The text gives the reading of the MSS„ which is, however,
scarcely genuine. As it is, we should have to take propera atque elue =
propera eluere, which would be a negligent construction, but might per-
haps be admitted, if it was not for the collocation of the adverb pure, to
place which in so prominent a position as it now holds we cannot see
any reason. Palmerius and Acidalius read pura propere, but the verb
parare seems altogether imaginary. I am therefore inclined to believe
in Guyet’s emendation prome propere atque elue which gives a very appro-
priate sense and is, at the same time, not far from the traces of the Μ88.

270. potest = pote εει 01· 111 later latinity possibile est. 80 again v.
275. This usage is confined to the language of the older poete.

senex hoc eodem poculo quo eqo bibi biberet. In English we may say with
the same simile to empty ιΙιε cup qs miffortune.

xl' · · INTRODUOTION.'

which in its integrity tnust always be considered to be thetendenc'y‘of·
language'l It is true, Ritschl says ‘ quid ἓ quod ne usu recepta quidem
monosyllaba scriptura alius uocis cuiusdam de uera ratione admonuit 7
‘nam quid est quo a monosyllaba bonas uel senem forma mnas differat
pro minas scribi solitum 2⁹ (p. cxmv). I intentionally give this passage·
without the least omission, as it would· otherwise be incredible that
Ritschl could have written such things.' Any one would at once see
that here Bitschl actually compares matters of a very different character.=
We want the proofs for the extrusion of a radical vowel in Latin
[Iambic] words, and Bitschl alleges the Greek μνᾶ, which the Romans ,
(to whom the joint consonants mn in the beginning of a syllable are
perfectly unknown) transformed into mina by inserting a short i: but
of course, the Greek form could equally well remain in use. That a
Roman could not say snex instead of senex, mnus for manus, qu’dem.
for quidem, seems, in the absence of any satisfactory evidence to the·
contrary, pretty clear 3 and indeed such forms as am’r and en’m (Prollr
Prin. oxma) may be good enough for Etruscan or Polish‚ but they are
no Latin? . Ι , “
The same arguments as those alleged in this extract, will be found·
in Gorssen’s ausepr. 2, 108 se. Ritschl has now himself entirely altered·
his theories, and I should not even have mentioned his former views‚
had it not been for the presumption that most of the current informa-
tion about Plautian prosody in this country is derived from Bitschl’s
Proleyomena, which, it must be repeated, ‘are in this respect entirely·
antiquated.
. I may add that, in accordance with the short quantities of uides
abis etc. we find uiden roqdn iuben adin redin etc„ forms which stand
for uidesne royame iubesne adime redime: see Oorssen, ausspr. 2, 104. ,

abandon our theory assoon as we learn of 'an iambic word actually extant in olden
times, and afterwards compressed into a monosyllable by the loss of the vowel of its
first syllable. As things stand now, we can only say that such forms as amul meso
mnus mlus prcul have by no means the appearance of Latin. For trux see more-

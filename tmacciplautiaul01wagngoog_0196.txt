the subj.). In polypus the first syllable is long, according to the Greek
πουλύπους (vehimus->2 comp. Hor. serm. 1 1, 40.

197. The comma after uolo is due to the printer and must be
omitted.

198. heu c. dat. is generally considered ungrammatical, see Zumpt
ξ 403 (in Prof. Key's Grammar Ι find nothing on this point). In Plautus
the MSS. give the phrase keu misero mihi Mero. 661. 770 3 Ritschl in
the first passage gives kei, in the second ei. On account of these pas—
sages 1 kept heu which I thought to be the reading of B 3 now we know
from Schwarzmann's collation that this MS. gives ei and so we should
write accordingly.

199. hamaqm, a hybrid verb formed from the Greek ἁρπαγή
repeatedly occurs in Plautus: Bacch. 657. Pseud. 139. 957. Trin. 289.

200. adire ad pactionem: pacisci, and hence the construction is to
be explained. See a similar case v. 281.-ime‘misam] ‘As uis· means
‘go 'and see'‚ so inter-uis- means ‘go and hunt up,' ‘go and see thoroughly
into.' Key, Transactions of the Phil. Soc. 1854 p. 67. This explana-
tion accounts for the acc. domum here and in the next line, which some
editors change into domi, but compare Mero. 555 interea tamen lmc ad
me interni-sam domum. Hildyard compares Men. prol. 51 εἰ quis quid
nostrum Epidwmnum curari uelit, where all our good MSS. read Epi-
damnum, while Ritschl’s edition has Epidamni on the authority of
Pylades‘ MSS„ i. e. on no authority. Hildyard rightly defends the acc.
‘ quia motus ad eum locum intelligitur.’

204. Camerarius explains ex paupertate ‘ ex ordine seu numero
pauperum, ut ex nobilitate? But this use of paupertas is not supported

by other examples. For eae see Key, L. G. § 1331 k.

¹ 205. perit = periit. This contraction is by no means scarce in Plautus
, and Terence: see Lachma‘l‘fin, comm. Lucr. p. 209 S. In common speech
these forms seem to have been much used, as appears from the perfects
audit perpoleit expolit seruit munic petit poscit posit all 'of which are
found in inscriptions: see Biicheler's note on Petronius p. 67, 16.—The
sense of the passage is therefore clear enough [rectify the crit. noteJ.
Euclio says ‘my money is allright (saluom), since nothing of it is gone!
Boxhorn gives the following explanation ‘salua res est, si salua dicenda
sit quae sicut nondum periit, ita potest aliquando perire,' but Ι cannot
elicit this sense from the text.

206. inbre redii ‘ went back into the huod—exanimum.- see·v. ⁴
179. ’
211. mque malis neque inprobis: see note on v. 190.

213. For mala malitia see on v. 42. malitia is often used by the
comic writers in the sense of cunning} or skrewdmss, e. g. Ter. Phorm.

633. ‘ The archaic particle em which in former editions was usually
replaced by the more recent form en, is in Plautus strongly recommended
by the best MSS. and very frequently necessary for the metre, e. g.
Mero. 11 2, 82. Pseud. 111 2, 100. Poen. 1 1, 79. Bacch. 11 3, 40. 1v 8,

confounded with it, is of a thoroughly pathetic nature and serves for ex-
pressing j0y‚ grief, surprise and bewilderment.’ Briae on Trin. 3.—On
the words ostende ctiam tertiam Thornton has the following note: ‘ This

Rom. Why here. Trin. But I mean, where 's your other hand 7
Ronc. Think you 1110 the giant with an hundred hands?
Trin. Give 1110 your right. Rom). My right? Tria. Your left. Ronc. My left?
Prin. Now both. Ronc. There ’s both, my dear Antonio!

639. tunica is the Latin for the Greek χιτών. The plural stands

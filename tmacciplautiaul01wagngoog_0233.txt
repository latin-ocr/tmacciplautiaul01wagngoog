EXEGETIOAI. ‘COMMENTARY. ἱ ’ 143

quoted there, note 2, Brix in his new edition justly keeps the reading of
the MSS.—crocire occurs only here 3 the long quantity of the o has
been unjustly suspected on account of an erroneous reading in the late
poem de Philomela, where Reifferscheid with Burmann rightly reads
crocitat ἐι coruus v. 28 (Suet. rell. p. 309), while former editors give ἐι
crocitat coruus„ From old glossaries Ι may mention comi crocciunc
(Reiff. p. 249) coruus croeit and coruos erasm-e (coaxare 2) uel crocitwre
ibid. p. 250, and to Suetonius’ Praesenti Reifferscheid refers the notice
coruomwn crocitwre p. 250 (crocant croccant creceium gyrabam several
MSS). Oomp. the Greek κρώζειν, German krc'iclwen and krc‘ilzen, English
to crow and croak.—Bothe's emendation fira would no doubt eon-
siderably improve the passage, but as it is not absolutely necessary, I
have not ventured to admit it into the text.

618. artem facere ludicram ‘ to dance,’ comp. note on ludim 399.
Plautus has similar expressions oisc. 11 3, 9 cor salit. Cas. 11 6, 9 corcu-
lum adsultasoit metu. ibid. 62 cor limosum habeo: iam dudum salit.
Oapt. 111 4,104 tu (cor) sussultans. In Greek we have the phrases καρ-
δία χορεύει (Soph. ), ὀρχεῖται καρδία φόβω (Aeschyl), ἤ πήδησις τῆς καρδίας
(Plato and Plut..)

620. On fords fords see Introd. p. xxxvr.

621. Brix conjectures peri. But the present peris emphatically
stands in the sense of the future peribis.

622. te miseris accipiam modis ‘ I shall treat you miserably.’ Oomp.

.· 623. Gomp. Bacch.. 11⁷ quid tibi conmercist cum dis damnosissumis ?
and Rud. 111 4, 20 nihil cum uestris leyibus mi est cowmeroi. Terence
says in the same sense quid tibi cwm. illa rei est? Eun. lv 7, 34. The
other phrase occurs only in Plautus. ’

625. uerberabilismmusis a comic superlative like ipsismmus Trin.

988, which is itself an imitation of αὐτότατος Arist. Plut. 83. Another '

superlative of the same kind is oculissumus Gurc. 1 2, 28.

627. Euclio dares not to name the real object of his search, lest ”

he might betray himself in case Strobilus should not be in the posses-
sion· of the secret. There is a ‘quibble in the Latin here, which is
however easily understood. Euclio takes tibi as dat. eth. , a turn
which cannot be rendered in English. Similar jokes occur M en. 645
and Οαῳι. 862.

628. According to note on 615, the reading of the MSS. might be
kept: (ecquid aqi-9? (drop s) quid aqam? (do not elide the m) auferre
‘non potes t: quid uis tibi? I am disposed to accept Weise's assertion.

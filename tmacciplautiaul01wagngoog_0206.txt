,and he. calls him a fur trtfihrmffer. On fiormfer 1 add the‘ explanation
given by Donatus on Andr. 111. 5, 12 ‘furmfiri dicebantur qui ob leue
delictum cogebantur a dominis ignominiae magis quam supplicii causa
circa uicinos furcam in eollo ferre, subligatis ad eam manibus, et praedi-
care peccatum suum simulque conmonere ceteros ne quid simile admit-
tant? tri- adds to the strength of the expression, comp. triueraefica
v. 86. The same word mfhrczfir occurs twice Rud. 111 2, 29 s. It is
„by no means the same with ter'ur v. 625.

325. For tac& see Introd. p. XXVII.

326. licet ‘it shall be done :’ for instances see Men. 158. 213. Most.

330. Such proceleusmatics as -tibi dabi- are not rarely found in the
second foot of iambics‚ though they oftener occur in the first. See
Bitschl‚ Proll. ccnxXXIX.

331. Pho-uqia i. e. Φρυγία was a very appropriate name for a music-
¹girl, a peculiar kind of flutes being called tibiae Phryyiae. See the
‘commentators on Tib. 11 1, 86. Cat. 63, 23 and J. F. Gronov’s obs.
Zac. 1 17 .

336. tibi recte facere ‘how could Ι plesse you2' The use of the
infinitivo of indignation is very common in the third person, but very
rare iu the second and first. Of the first, Lachmann in his note on
Lucr. 11 16 gives only two instances: the present passage in the Aulu-
laria and Ter. Andr. v 2, 29 tamtum laborem capere ob talem filium?

rendo): see also v 2, 54 s. Catullus expresses the same defessus. . essem
te mihi, amice, quam-itando .· c. 55 in Haupt’s edition.

: 340. The reading of this line is not quite certain. If the MS. J
actually were more trustworthy than we consider it to be, there would
be no doubt that autem would have to be inserted aster hia—For the
pronunciation of aput see Introd. p. XXXIV.

- 342. For quod abstinere (‘ to abstain from which’) see Key, L. G.
ξ 909. This construction was not understood by some medieval gram-
marians who wrote thereforefacile, and this reading' Is actually found m
16 late MSS. besides the MS. J. See Introd. p. XI.

344. The spelling quoqui instead of coqui or coci owes its origin to

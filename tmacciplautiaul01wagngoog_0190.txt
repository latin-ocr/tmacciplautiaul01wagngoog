100 EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY.

137. The accentuation optcima would be startling to those who ¹
believe in a general tendency of Plautian prosody to preserve the com-
mon accentuation of daily life. There are, however, many instances of
such metrical paroxytona as optuma to be found in Plautus and the other
comio poets. Comp. desine (Naeu. 60. anc. 60. Ribb.). piscibus Rud.

Ritschl, proll. Prin. p. ccxxlv. Bentley (Schediasma p. xlv ed. LipS.
1791) observes on such cases as these ‘ nescio equidem, an in Terentio
quoque, cuin trimetrum aliquoties inchoet ab Hicine, Hocine, Libera,
non iu primam retrahendus sit accentus Libera dvc. etiam in IambicO...
tale etiam illud Plauti Rud. 11 6, 29 piscibus in altomubi Piscibus liben-
tius efferrem quam Piscibus? In accordance with Bentley, Prof. Key
would iu all these cases adopt the common accentuation, for in his paper
‘ on Greek accentuation’ (Transact. of the Phil. S. 1855 p. 134) he says
that ‘Greek [and Latin] iambics agreed with our own [English] in the
occasional admission of what was virtually a trochee at the outset of a
trimeter.’ He therefore reads

sic me di amabunt, fit me tuarum miseritumst
Ter. Haut. tim. 111 1, 54. ·

id sibi ‘negoti credidit solum dari
Ter. Andr. prol. 2.

 

In the latter instance, Prof. Key would no doubt treat sibi as a monosyl-
lable (see ‘Alphabet’ p. 147 and L. G. ξ 1172 note)-a pronunciation
which Ι should however not admit (see Introd. p. xv note). The only
arguments which could be alleged for a theory which is so'much opposed
to our common metrical creed, seem to rest on some Greek iambics
which however admit of other explanations: in Παρθὲνοπαῖος (Sept. ad
Theb. 553) and Ἰππόμέδοντος (ib. 484) the antecedent vowels are length·
ened by the influence of ⁴the following liquide, which were notoriously
of a very strong pronunciation in the inlaut. I may add that V. 553
is considered spurious by Dindorf and weil, not on account of the
quantity of Παρθενοπαῖος, but on other grounds, In v. 484 Bitschl
conjectures μέγ’ Ἱππομέδοντος σχῆμα καὶ μέγας τρόπος, where the legiti-
mate quantity would be preserved. In Ἀλφὲσίβοιαν (Soph. fragm.) we
easily recognise the ⁴same process as in the Homeric dative πάντεσσι

instead of πάντεσι dvc. But Prof. Key contends also that in such a line
as soph. Phil. 740 ·

τί thre πέπονθας; οὐκ ἐρεΐς, ἀλλ’ ὧδ’ {cei

 

 

we ought to pronounce τίπτε (at least so I understand his words). This
would indeed be the same as the beginning of au English iamhic This ie

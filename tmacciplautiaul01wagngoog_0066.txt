lii Ι INTRODUOTION.

male perditus pessume ornam eo.
Aul. 713.

me despoliat, mea ornamenta clam ad meretrices degerit.
Men. 804.

lepide factumst : iam ex sermone hoc gubernabunt doctius porro.
Glor. 1091.

cassidem in caput—dormibo placidule in tabernaculo.
Trin. 726.

δ. be (με),

ego opsonabO. nam id flagitium sit mea te gratia
Bacch. 97¹.

scio absurde dictum hoc derisores dicere
“ Capt. 1 1, 3 (271 Fl.)²

and even in such a word as abstulisti the first syllable appears shortened
Aul. 637 ⁸. It is very difficult now to find these instances in Ritschl’s

text⁴‚ since they are all eliminated by means of conjectures sometimes

very arbitrary, e.g. Glor. 542 s. the MSS. (ABG) would give us the
following text: ’

perque tua genua ε quid obsecras me? z: inscitiae
meae et stultitiae ignoscas. nunc demum scio

In this case quid obsecras me would be a very natural and con—

venient question, the slave having said two lines before te obsecro.
Ritschl gives, however, as follows:

perque tua genua :t quid iam? :t meae ut inscitiae
et meae stultitiae ignoscas. nunc demum scio

¹ This is the reading 01 ‘all the MSS. and Fleckeisen’s edition gives the line in
accordance with it. Bitschl's however transposes 6psonabo eqo.

² Fleckeisen (ep. crit. 111) was inclined to transpose dictum apsurde. He would
not do so now.

³ A Saturnian line of Livius Andronicus seems to testify to the short quantity
of the syllable -ups- in Calupsonem:

apud numiam Atlantis filiam Calupsonem.

This is at least Biicheler’s opinion, jahrb. fiir class. phil. 1863 p. 332.

⁴ As regards Fleckeisen’s text, we must draw the reader's attention to the great
difference between his first and second volume. In the first he depende almost
entirely on Bitschl's principles, while in the second he is more conservative in
consequence of the metrical and rhythmical discoveries made by him in his article
on Bitschl’s Plautus. In his first volume he did not admit obsecras (Glor. 542): in
his second we have opsonabo (Bacch. 97).

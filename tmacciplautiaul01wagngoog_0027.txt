v. 67 we find a ridiculous emendation in J ’s text instead of the
genuine reading preserved in B. The emendator was happier in his
conjecture on v. 81, though he simply did not understand the reading
he found in his archetype, or else he would not have tried a conjecture
at all.—I should not ascribe the reading found in J v. 141 to emen·-
dation: a grammarian who changed sis into si in another passage
(v. 652), would not be ingenious enough to substitute sis for si quid
uis: we are, therefore, of opinion that J ’3 archetype differed here
from B—But what shall we say of the unhappy dexterity of our
emendator who changed suom, which in his archetype was only a slight
error for sactom=factum‚ into sacca, a form which in that passage sins
equally against the metre and the grammar Q—v. 253 J has a reading
in its text which seems to be the conjecture of a grammarian3 the
same is added over the line in B.—v. 277-12110 traces of ἲΝ ΜΙΧΤί Μ·
were mistaken for MINIXTUM by the scribes of B, and instead of
this uox nihili we have mixtum in J and later MSS„ which is, how-
ever, against the metra—My note on v. 343 gives two instances of
J ’3 inferiority to B. First, the genuine reading facile was corrected
into facere, because the emendator did not understand the construc-
tion quod te abstinere posse seim· secondly‚ the distribution of the verses
is in the worst confusion, though it is already wrong in B. The
same passage shows the dependency of the later MSS. upon J.—-The
strongest proof, however, is v. 241, where J omits a word on account
of the metre: the line is actually a trochaic septenarius, but by some
strange accident it stands now among iambics. This the emendator
tried to remedy by omitting a word which, if it is only for the sense
of the line, may well be omitted ¹.

Ι could easily draw more instances from other lines of the Aulu-
laria or from other plays3 but as Ι think the above passages fully
sufficient to show the truth of my assez-tion, 1 leave it to curious
readers to collect more examples for themselves, if they should be
anxious to have them all together. It seems to me from the instances
given that J is a corrected copy of an archetype which followed almost

399. ludius is in Labbaeus’ Glossaries p. 109 rightly explained
ὕποκριτής. Τ1161111611 remarks ‘ The ludii were young lads employed in
the public spectacles ; our author adds uolsus (plucked), because they
used at the time of puberty to have the down or hairs plueked from
their chins to keep their faces smooth.’ The word is 116 doubt connected
with ludere ‘to play,’ and the common spelling lydius due to the 6116-
neous derivation from 13116 Lydii, i. e. Etruscans: 666 Dionys. Halic. 11
97. Oomp. ludio.

401. faciunt officium suum is of course ironically meant: ‘you could
not expect cooks to do otherwise, they only do their duty, at least 66-
cording to their own notions.’ Hildyard compares Asin. 11 2, 113 quin
tu officium sacis erqo ao suqis? and Pseud. 913 fait meum officium (ut

403 ss. Congrio comes running out of Euclio's house and implores
the assistance of the citizens against the furor of the old man.

403. optati ciues ‘beloved‚ dear citizens ε’ comp. Oic. ad Quintum
fr. 11 8 vade, mi optime et optatissime frater. This sense is best known
in the compound exoptatus. Bothe actually proposes the superfluous
and false conjecture opdati or obdati, which he explains obuiam dact—³
Similar scenes to this 616 frequent in the 6611116 poete: see 6. g. Rud.
111 2 and Ter. Ad. 11 1.

404. ‘ The Greek words which Plautus employs, are first naturalized
and assume something of a Roman dress. πλατεῖα, for example, with its
long penult becomes in Plautus, and indeed in Terence als0, platea, and
so easily passes through the Italian piazza into the French and N orman-
English place. Similarly γυναικεῖον takes in Latin comedy the shape of
yymeceum or rather cinaeceuml Key, Trans. of the Phil. Soc. 1861 p.

405. The same expression oppido perii recurs v. 793, comp. the
similar oppido interii v. 721 and Amph. 1 1, 43.—For the expression
habuit me qumnasiwm comp. Asin. 11 2, 31 where Leonidas greets his
follow-slave Libanus with 1116 words qumnasium flaqri, saluom—In pro-
nouncing 1116 word senem the final x should be dropt: 666 Introd. p:

406. In the words basolus and bacchanal I have omitted the
aspiration after the 6, 611166 11 was not written in the time of Plautus:
comp. the senatusconsultum de Bacanalibus. To be quite consistent, I
should even have given a simple c (Introd. p. xm): but this I thought
rather too much for the eyes and minds of most of my readers. · I have
moreover spelt these words with a small b, because they should rather
be considered as general terms than as proper nouns. Plautus fre-

111 31, 112 all the MSS. give cum prima luca—In a fable of Ennius ren-
dered in prose by Gellius 11 29 (Eun. ed. Vahlen p. 160) we have prmo
buci, which is the reading of the cod. Reg. of Gronovius, recent MSS.

have prima luca—The phrase luci claro is quoted from Varro’s Syne-
phebus by Nonius 2103 see Varro Bip. ed. p. 309.--Ι11 general comp.

Charisius p. 203 ed. Keil. luci (e. g. M en. 1006) is to be considered
as an adverb like mani heri (mame here) 3 see Key, L. G. ξ 784. It
shows clearly that these adverbs are originally ablatives, since it is con-

strued with adj. and prepositions. Comp. moreover the phrase cwm
primo mame in the Bell. Afr. c. 62. cum luci simul Stich. 364.

743. ‘ Love and wine are base and contemptible things, if a drunken
hot-brained youth be allowed to do anything without fear of punishment.'
This is the plain sense of the passage, though it is not understood by
Lambinus and 15116 011161 00111111611181018. Heinsius even conjectures
nimis utile, which is against the metre.

747. For the construction comp. Ter. Haut. tv‘sm. 1v 1, 22 interemp-
tam oportuit ‘ you should have killed her.’ Amph.. 11 2, 108 comprecatam

oportuit. In such phrases Plautus commonly omits esee: see G'lor. 1336.

752. Ε110110 speaks ironically ‘ Of course you will be legitimate pos-
sessor, unless you restore the obj ect.’ Thus we need not transpose the
lines 7 52 and 753, 88 Acidalius was inclined to do.

758. immo: ‘ I don't only deny it, but I obstinately deny it.’ The
only other passage where immo stands in the second place, is Gap& 11
2, 104.

759. For neque scio nec noui see n. on v. 190.

762. For the hiatus de a— see Introd. p. mum—The emendation
qaae is due to some Italian scholar of the 15111 century, as appears from
the cod. Burneianus 228, 111 which it is found.

765. Η816 compares C‘apt. 1v 2, 110 dio bonan fide, tu mi istaec
uerba dimisum: z bona. In this passage bom certainly is affirmative, but
it would be quite preposterous to conclude that we therefore ought to

lxiv INTRODUOTION.

ADDEN DA.

Long after the text and nearly the whole Introduction were printed,
the editor was by the kindness of Prof. Fleckeisen at Dresden enabled
to give all the readings of the MS. B with that degree of exactness and
accuracy which is indispensably necessary for all critical purposes.
Although all possible care had been taken to find out the actual
readings of B, it was in more than one instance impossible to arrivs at
the positive truth. All such doubts have now vanished, since by means
of the following addenda to the critical commentary it will be easy
enough to ascertain the reading of the MSS. in each single instance.
While Ι have to thank Prof. Fleckeisen for this valuable contribution'
to the critical part of the present work, Ι must excuse myself to my
readers for the inconvenience necessarily arising from this late addition
to the critical notes. But I may presume that for many of them it
will be no very serious inconvenience, since the passages which must be
altered in consequence of our better knowledge of the MS. , are not
above two or three, and are moreover all pointed out in the exegetical
commentary: those readers who would really study the critical notes,
will, Ι hope, kindly overlook a slight inconvenience and rather rejoice
at having an accurate knowledge of the most important authority for
‘the text of the Aulularia ¹.

· The collation thus liberally placed at my service was made by
Mr A. Schwarzmann, during his sojourn at Rome, 1835. It is written
'in a very neat and clear hand on the margins of the Amsterdam edition,
a. 1721. (See Fleckeisen, ep. crit. v). In using the following ad-
ditions, it should be observed that unless there is an express remark
to the contrary, the statements contained in the critical commentary
must be considered right 5 but in any other case all statements given in
the ‘Addenda’ are more authentic than the former. Ι have moreover
carefully indicated where my statements rest on Schwarzmann's silence,
i. e. where he adds nothing to the reading found in the edition used by

² 1 may add that the final cause 01 this inconvenience rests with the post which
lost a letter from Prof. Fleckeisen to the author at the end 01 August 1865.

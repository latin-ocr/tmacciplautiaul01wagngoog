 

ExsommAL COMMENTARY. 99

125. Lambinus’ note on this line is well worth preserving. ‘Ego
tamen,' he says, ‘ qui cum haec scriberem, annum aetatis agebam LVI,
duas mutas mulieres uidi? This provokes old Taubmann’s fun, who for
his part assures Lambinus, that at an age of 29 he knew already more
than two dumb women.—Ben J onson (Silene Womcm 1 5) calls a woman's
silence ‘ a wealthy dowry.'

127. Adelphasium uses almost the same words Poen. 1 2, 28 itaet.-
uerum hoc einum tamen coqitdto. ,

130. A construction onemo-e alicui does not exist. The passage
quoted by Forcellini‚ Truc. lv l, 12 (= 698 Geppert) proves nothing:
the MSS. BG give quia nil habes, unum· animus moui mihi omnia, but
the MSS. used by Lambinus read monuit me (νωτιαῖα omnia without
mihi is the reading found in a MS. at Paris collated by Geppert). It is
therefore clear enough that in this line the datives depend on consedere
and monere follows its analogy.

131. muesoere is explained by Nonius 427, 15 ‘hom-inum occulte
quid et pressa uoce- loquentium? The frequentative mussitare (e. g. metu
mussitant Cas, 111 5, 33) is explained by Donatus on Ter. Ad. 11 1, 53
⁴ prop‘mle est dissimulmii causa taem-e, dictum uel a muto uel ab M, quae
. littera est nimium pressae uocis ac paene nullius, adeo ut sola omnium,
cum inter uocales inciderit, atteratur atque subsidat) Comp. the English
to mutter and see Munro on Lucr. VI 1179. ‘

133. For fords see Introd. p. xxxv1. Though it appears to us strange
that a confidential conversation should purposely take place in a public
street, we should not forget that the constant habit of the Roman
comedy compelled the poets to let all such things pass in the streets as
would otherwise require a more appropriate scenery. Oomp. Pompon.
142 ss. Ribb. eqo dedita opera te, pater, solum sorae seduxi, ut ne quis

esset testis tertius Praeter nos·
134. As the metre shows that a syllable is wanting in the reading

given of this line by the MSS. (for a hiatus between rem and eqo is
perfectly impossible), I had ventured to write conloquerm but think
now to have a better conjecture to substitute to such an unhappy de·
pravation of the text as this would be. I should now write uti tuoem

rem eqo tecam hic loquerer-familiarem.

135. fhmiuci] For the long quantity of the voc. -a see Introd. p.
xva—quis east] ‘ quis and quem in old writers are sometimes feminine)
Key, L. G. ξ 310. See v. 168. Instances of this usage are collected by
N onius 197, 30 sa—For the separation of nam from quis, see note on
v. 42.

136. ais and ait are generally monosyllables in Plautus, aio and
aiunt never. See Bitschl, proll. Prin. cnxn. Key‚ L. G. ξ 739.

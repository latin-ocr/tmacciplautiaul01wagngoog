In the passive, the shortening propensities of the Latin language
have chiefly displayed themselves in the first person of the singular. In
Plautus we find sometimes the original quantities ὃν dr ⁸, nay ferar is
met with as late as Ovid (Μ et. v11 61). Analogously, the endings er
and rer in the subj. were originally long. ’

It may finally be remarked that with the comio poets se (⁴ thou
art’) is invariably long. ’

Β. IRREGULAR SHORTENING oF LONG FINAL VOWELS.

All these long vowels are, however, of but occasional occurrence
in Plautus and Terence—they are, indeed, nothing more than a few

scattered traces of a period of the language, which was rapidly waning
and dying away. The qemi-al character of the lang-uage in the times
of Plautus was quite different. A destructive element had already
commenced its powerful influence upon the language, and had already
deeply affected and altered the original quantity of many endings and
even of many root-vowels of Latin words, The accent in Latin never
falls on the last syllable, and its tendency was to destroy the length
of this last syllable⁸‚ especially in case the word was disyllabic and
had a short penult.

We find, therefore, in Plautus more instances in which the above
mentioned archaic long vowels have been shortened than where they
still retain their original quantity—and this must be attributed to the
influence of the accent. But the language did not stop there 3 on the
contrary, many short quantities are to be found in the comio poets

which were either entirely rejected or but exceptionally admitted by
later poets.

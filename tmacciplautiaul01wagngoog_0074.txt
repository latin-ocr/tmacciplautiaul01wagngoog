timescat qui uocales nolit coniunqere? The only question which 'is still
sub iudice is therefore, how far the comic poets indulged in a licence
which we must admit they used in their metres.

‘Pal-ry, in his Introduction ιο Terence, p. nvn sets down three mles
which would serve ιο explain the admissibility of hiatus, viz: hiatus,
he sayra, is justified, ’

(1) by the sense of the passage,
(2) by the punctuation,

(3) in exclamatione, such as heia hercle eleo heus.

Setting aside the third rule, which has indeed a general value for
all Latin poets, we confine ourselves ιο a more detailed discussion of
the first two rules. We may define the matter more accurately in· the

following manner.
Hiatus is justified:
(a) where the line is divided among two or more speakers,
(b) by caesura.

. The latter point in its full extent was long disputed by Ritschl, but

at last he began to allow a greater freedom and to relax the severity of
his original views, as will be seen in the instance of the hiatus in the

caesura of the trochaic septenarius (praefi Men. p. x ss.) This occurs

in the Aulularia v. 174. 250. 638. Βιιι he does not allow a hiatus in
the caesura of an iambic senarius ‘ ut quae in melium ordinem rhyth-
micum ‘incidat’ (Proll. p. CXCVI). Still he deviates from this law in such
an instance as Prin. 432

tempfist adeundi :z estne hic Philto qui aduenit

because in this case the line is divided among two speakers. In the
Aululwmla we have two instances of the same kind of hiatus, viz. 305
and 530:

immo equidem credo :: at scin etiam qn6modo?
ain audiuisti? :z usque a principio omnia.

In both instances it would not be very difficult ιο avoid the hiatus
by writing set instead of αι in the, first, and inserting aio before usque
in the second line. But as a hiatus of this kind is by no means very
rare, we shall adhere, to the authority of our Mss,

9 2 EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY.

given by Jacob Grimm. The word corresponds therefore entirely with
the Greek οὖδ-αμ·ὣς, and οὐδ-έν, the latter being frequently used as a
simple negation in later Greek and constantly so in modern Greek,
where we have however the shortened form δέν. As to the Latin word,
we may observe that this passage seems the only one in which at least
one good MS. has kept it. In Ennius we read it in three places: ann.
161 sommia uera aliquot, uerum omnia noenu necessest (non nunc the
MSS„ ‘noenu H. Ilberg) 3 ann. 314 noenum rumores ponebat wate salutem
(non emim the MSS. ‚ noenum Lachmann) ; and amn. 411 noenum spe·
rande cupide rem prodere summam (non in the MS). When judging
from these examples, it is not without probability that in many passages
in Plautus where we now read ‘non enim, we have to replace the original
reading noenum, e. g. in the' Aulularia itself v. 586 where non enim
seems to have no clear meaning. See Biicheler‚ jahrb. fiir class. phil.

186301). '‘getica-s .· see on v. 7. There is no tauffllogy in this line’ the

full meaning of which may be rendered by the following translation ‘it
often happens that he turns me out of deors ten times a-day!

71. For the disyllabic pronunciation 7116εοῖ5 see Introd. mm.—
intemperiae ‘whim·whams’ (Pharum), see v. 634. Epid. 111 4, 39.

7 2. Interdius (ἀν’ ἡμέραν) is read here and Most. 444 ; the simple
dius occurs in opposition to noctu Mero. 862, and Charisius expres-<ly
states that Titinius used noctu diu-sque .· see Ribb. Gom. p. 116 5 it is an
old acc. neutr. diu (as seen in the usual form interdiu) arose after the
final 8 had been dropt (Introd. p. xxm). From the Sanskr. divas we

have in Latin both dies and dius (comp. ‹liar-nus, where the original ε
is changed into an r). See Corssem ausapr. 2, 295. Ion't. beitr. zur

to take to such a sedentary employment as that of a cobbler.' Ritey.

74. ems and its derivatives are better spelled without an initia] h,
and the MS. B generally gives it so, while J adds the aspiration. See
Ritschl, Prole. Prin. Ρ. XCVIII, praefi Stichi p. 11111 and our critical
note on Aul. 591. The same genuine spelling is found in the oldest
MSS. of Ovid: see Merkel's pref. to the Teubner edition, vol. 1, Ρ. xm.
2, p. lx.

76. The repetition of the words* queo comminisci may perhaps
appear strange, still such repetitions are not inconsistent with the
character of a garrulous old woman, and afford no ground for entertain-
ing any suspicion of the genuineness of the reading. Such seeming

κ negligence must be allowed to a 6611116 poet. Α

xxiv mrnonucnon.

in fer& but in Plautus we find probe with the same short quantity
(Poen. v 5, 1. Pseud. 603. Persa 650) ¹. The adverb cito had its final

ο common in all periods of Latin poetry ⁸. ¹

The ablative-ending e of the third declension was originally long,
6. g. in the following line from the sepulchral inscription of Scipio
Barbatus:

Gnaiu6d patre? prognAtus, fortis uir sapiensque.

In the comic poets, however, this ending is short⁸.
i in the ablativo of the third declension appears shortened in
an anapaestic line from Plautus’ Bacchides (1 108)

igitur pari fortuna, aetate ut sumus, utimur :z sic est. set tu.
This is the reading of the MSS. adopted by Fleckeisen.
The ἰ of the dative is shortened in cani:

cani quoque etiam ademptumst nomen...
Epid. 11 2, 50.

 

u of the fourth is shortened in manti Trin. 288. It is the same ·

with the e of the fifth, which is occasionally found short, e. g. Poen. 1v
2, 68 Fide non melius creditur.

¹ Μ. Grain, plaut. stud. p. 10. 111 the line from the Persa Ritschl expressly
aclmowledges the short final e.

² For Plautus see Rstschl, Proll. Trin. p. cnm3 for later poets L. Miiller, de re
metr. p. 335, and on the whole point Key, L. G. 5 772 with note.
Bitschl and Fleckeisen admit even prospere in 611 anapaestic line, Pseud. 574.
It is, however, highly probable that this line is to be read as 6 trochaic octonarius:
pro Iouis, ut mihi quidquid ago lepide omnia prospereque eueniunt.

'I'he MSS. give Iuppiter.- Ι have followed Biicheler’s emendation (rhein. mus. xv
p. 445).—1n another anapaestic line, G lor. 1024, Bitschl reads with the MSS.
age, age, fit tibi mamm& concinnumst.
Prot. Haupt proposes to transpose the words as follows
age maxume uti tibi c6ncinnumst.

It is difficult to decide how 161· 6 licence would extend in the so-called ‘ free ’ metres;
yet in the first instance we are entitled to remove it because trochaic metre follows;
in the second 1 should not admit Haupt's conjecture.

⁸ See Gorssen‚ amspr. 1, 332.—1t may be useful to call the attention of scholare

to an instance of a long e in the abl. sing. which as yet seems isolated‚ viz. Gapt.
iv 2, 27 (= 807 Fl.):

tum pistores scr6phipasci, qui alunt furfur} sues.
Camerarius and with him almost all editors give furfuri, which is 6 form 61 modern

1 3 2 EXEGETIGAL OOMMENTARY.

tial says in one of his epigrams (111 62) that mules ‚were sometimes sold
at a. higher price than whole houseS. Hildyard quotes Iuv. vn 181.

491. uiliores has here its original meaning ‘ cheaper.’ cantherius
(according to the original spelling of the time of Plautus still found in
several places in our MSS„ we should have canterius) 'is the Greek
κανθήλιος (for the change of l and r see Key ‘Alphabet’ p. 7 5) ‘geld-
ings? They were not highly valued and generally considered to be lazy
and sleepy, comp. Men. 395 canterino astans ritu somniat.

493. The syllables nimis lepi- form a proceleusmatic, the 8 in nimis
being dropt: Introd. p. xxm-lepidus is very difficult to translate by
one word in its different shadeS, though the schoolboy's English furnishes
us with the equally flexible term jouy. The word is very frequent in
the comic writers, we find it afterwards in Catullus (l, l. 6, 17. 36, 10)
and for the last time in Horace, ars poet. 273.—ad ‘for ι’ see Key, L.
G. § 1305 e.

496. enim frequently has the sense of enimuero: see Key, L. G.
§ 1449, and the commentators on Caesar b. 9. v 7, 8. Ruhnken on Ter.
Phorm. Ν 4, 13 justly observes ‘ solis comicis quos Appuleius imitatur,
‘usitatum est hanc particulam aduersatiuam ab initio ponere.‘

497. The spelling pedissequos as found in BJ, is very incorrect
though at the same time of very frequent occurrence even in the best
MSS. and several times met with in old inscriptions, Butif nothing else,
the metre would teach us that it is wrong. See Ruhnken's note on Ter.
Andr. 1 1, 96.

498. salmiqerulus is a ἅπ. λεγ. Τ1ιο editors quote ‘salutiymdus
ἔπισκέπτης’ from the glosses collected by Labbaeus p. 163 3 we may
compare the analogous formatione sandaliqemhla Trin. 252, and nuqv‘ye-
nllus, as our MSS. give Aul. 518. salutiyer occurs in Ausonius
(salutiqer Iuppiter and salutiqeri libelli), Prudentius (salutiyen‘ mes)
and Appuleius (de deo Socr. p. 674 ed. Delph.), who calls the demons
salutiqeri ‘ qui ultro citroque portant hinc peticionee, inde suppetias?
'Ibe meaning is rightly explained by a French translator ‘ petits laquais
qu’ on envoye de cote et d' autres pour savoir des nouvelles de ses amiS,
leur faire des compliments de notre part '-——in short tiqerse—For qui see
Key, L. G. § 312.

500. For the accentuation moribus see note on v. 137. For the
whole passage we may compare a fragment from Cic. de republ. Ν neo

uero mulieribus praefectus praeponatur qui apud Graecos creari solet:
aed sit censor qui uiros doceat moderari uxoribus. It would be easy to

conjecture that there actually was a scheme on foot to propose the in-

stitution of γυναικονόμοι or γυναικοκόσμοι in Rome such as there were in
several Greek republics‚ and that Plautus ventured to hint at this.

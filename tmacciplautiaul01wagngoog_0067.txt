'Every “ friend of Plautian poetry must therefore agree ‘with the
opinion of Prof. Key who calls Ritschl’s text ‘ in not a few instances·
untmstworthy,’ because it differs ‘ what with omissions, insertione,
changes and transpositions of words, and not unfrequently of lines, from
what the MSS. sanction, by a vcry considerable per-centage.' These

matters will, 'it is hoped‚ be all set right in a second impression of
Ritschl’s Plautus, which is destined to give us the mature results of the

indefatigable investigatione of the revered sospitator Plauti.

But we shall stop here, though it would be easy to accumulate more
examples of similar ‘ violations of prosody.' We use this expression,
although it is entirely false when applied to Plautus or other comic
writers. For them that prosody which obtains in Horace and virgil,
did not exist, and they could not therefore sin against it. Their sole

guide in prosodiacal matters was their ear, and in many cases, they
obeyed the dictates of the rhythmical, rather than of the quantitative,
laws of the language. This shows the influence which the accent
exercised on the qucmtity of many syllables—a fact not at all to be
confounded with another question: did the ancient Roman poets pur-
posely attempt to reomao me metricat amem <ff cheir verses with, me

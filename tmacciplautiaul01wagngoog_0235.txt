EXEGETIGAL OOMMENTARY. 1 4 5

640. How kindly (benique) you allow me to feel everywhere!

643. a is the genuine spelling of the interjection, not ah, as we
learn from the best MSS.

645. How little constant the language in Plautus’ time was with
regard to the distinct use of deponent and active forms, we see here in a
striking instance: 643 we have εονιιιανί, 645 perconctatus ee, but 649
perscrutaui.

646. penes is rarely placed after the word which it governs: see
Key, L. G. ξ 1349 where Ter. Hoc. 1v 1, 20 is quoted. Such an artificial
collocation however as we have here is in Plautus quite isolated. Oorssen,
auespr. 2, 297 connects this preposition with penu penus penitus, and
says that it originally meant ‘in the storo-room'

648. amittere, as Brix on Gapt. 36 rightly observes, has in the la-
tinity before Cicero frequently the sense of dimittere—It would be pos-
sible, though not necessary, to write hinc abierit.

651. For sociennus :socius see Nonius as quoted in the crit. notes.
—interstrinqam.· see Key, L. G. ξ 1342, 1 e.

652. Hare compares a similar passage Cae. 11 4, 23 abin hinc ab
oeulis ?

653. emortuos ‘completely dead? Key, L. G. ξ 1332 g.

654. For the hiatus dem lw— see Introd. p. Lx111.

657. The syllables foris crepa form a proceleusmatic: see Introd.
p. xxm. For the matter see the commentatore on Ter. Andr. lv 1, 59
and Ad. 11 3, 11. ·

658. Α more correct reading would be huc eqo ad ianuam conces-
sere. 1t is obvious to understand this of Megadorus' house, near whose

door the slave hides himself.
659. Charisius takes Fide as a genitive, as appears from the passage
quoted in the crit. notes: it seems however much more natural to take

it as a dative (Key, L. G. ξ 966). In the same way we have Fide 667.
660. For the explanation of the phrase os alicui sublinere (‘to
deceive, to cheat’) see Nonius as quoted in the crit. notes. Gronovius
observes that this ludicrous practice is mentioned by virg-il, Ecc. vl 22
(Aegle) smzquineie frontem moris et tempora pinqit, and by Petronius
Sat. 22 (p. 23 Biich.) cwm Ascyltos...in somnum laberetur, illa...ancilla
totam faciem eius fidiyine {onya perfricuit et non sentientis labra wne-
rosque sopiti cwbonibue pinxit. Gronovius quotes the following instances
of this phrase in Plautus: Glor. 11 5, 47. Mero. 11 4, 17. capt. 111 4,

123.-F0r paenieeum see note on 463.
662. illum coruom ad me ueniat uelim is a well known construction

instead of ille coruos ad me ueniat uelim.
663. iwaniec, see Men. 304. 828. ,842 in Bitschl’s edition. θ

1 1 2 EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY.

Aer III.

Summus returns from the market with two cooks and two music-girls
whom Megadorus has hired for the celebration of his nuptials with
Euclio’s daughter. In the following dialogue between Strobilus and the
cooks we have a lively, though comically exaggerated, picture of Euclio's
meanness and avarice.—Comp. Athen. xlv p. 659 b μάλιστα δὲ εἰσά-

γονται (sc. ἐν τῇ νέᾳ κωμῳδίᾳ) μαγειροὶ σκωπτικοί τινες and Meineke, M en.

et Philam rell. 1823 p. 64. .
278. obsonare ‘to get victualsss ‘to market,' e.g. Bacch.. 97. 143.

obsonari as deponent stands v. 293. Comp. Stich. 681 Stichus obsona-

ἐπεὶ ‘has bought the provisions! A parallel passage is found in Ter.
Andr. 11 6, 20 where most of the MSS. give uix, inquit, drachmis obso-
natus est (‘ Vaticanus et nonnulli alii' est obsonatus) decem: and this
would give a very good sense ‘he has spent scarcely ten drachms on
provisions? Bentley, however, adopts the reading of two of his MSS.
est obsonatum, in support of which he compares Plaut. Bacch.. 1 2, 35.
Fleckeisen gives the same reading and Parry has not even a note on the
passage. Ι should keep the common reading, which is sufficiently de·
fended by the passage quoted from the Stichus—For conduxit coquos
see Pliny as quoted in the critical note 'on v. 397.
. 279. The form tibicenas rests on an erroneous statement of
Pareus. See Introd p. mum—apud here drops its final d: see Introd. p'.
xxan—-forums comp. Pseud. 790 s. forum coquinam qui uocant, stulte
uocant: Nam non coquinumst, uerum fibrinum forum.

281. Congrio plays upon his own name and the expression disper-
tire obsonium used by Strobilus. Under obsonium and ὄψον especially
fiale. was understood, whence ὀψάριον in the language of the New Testa-
ment· simply means ‘ fish' (comp. the modern Greek ψάρι). Strobilus
having signified his intention to divide the obsonium into two parts,
Congrio replies that he shall certainly not divide him, just as if he was
afraid of being comprehended under the category of fiola, the conqer
being a kind of ecl, which was cut into pieces before it was cooked
(comp. v. 396). For dispertire he substitutes diuidere, a word which is
sometimes used in an obscene sense: see Petron. 11 p. 13 Biicheler.
. 284. AntraX, the other cook who seems more honest but less witty
than Congrio, catches at Congrio’s expression hic tam palam, and calls
him therefore pudicum prostibulum, adding as his suspicion that Congrio
would perhaps not obstinately refuse to yield to such a proposal, if made

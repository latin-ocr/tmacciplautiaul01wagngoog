90 -EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY.

nimium σε’ ueqroendi yradu. Pacuvius v. 37 Ribb. has praemando: ργασία.
The word itself is explained by Nonius as qrandem facere, and examples
are quoted from Varro, Plautus, Lucretius, Accius and Pacuvius. For
the formation of this future and the imperfecte in ibam instead of iebam,
see Key, L. G. § 461 and 468. Τ116 imperfects are not only confined
to arehaic latinity, but occasionally appear even in later poets ς eg.
we find scibat in Catullus (68, 85) and laryiboer in Propertius (1 3, 25).
The e of the suffixes ebo and ebwm must have been originally long, and
appears as such in the so-called third and fourth conjugatione, where
.we have the normal forms leq-&bam wdi-Zbam. But we find like-
wise the future tenses. eoeuy-Zbo Plaut. Epid. 11 2, 5. dic-&bo Ribb.
com. p. 216 and fid-Zbo ibid. The e was afterwards affected by the
-same shortening process which so many endings in the Latin language
-had to undergO, and after it was shortened, it could 116 contracted in
the verbs of the first and second conj ugation‚ where we have ama—&bam
..ama-&bam ama-bam and doce-&barm doce-&barm doce-bam. The same was
no doubt beginning to work in the fourth conjugation‚ where madi-&bam
was transformed into (audi-eham) aud-ibam and the original madi-&bo
into aud-ibe. But there the shortening process was never entirely
worked out and the original quantity always remained predominant—
This is, at least, my view of the matter3 but I shall not neglect to
advise my readers to compare the different views developed by Oorssen,
loric. beitr. zur lat. formenl. p. 539-541, and Key, L. G. § 466, note †.
With testudineus yradus ‘ tortoise-pace’ we may compare formiciwas
yradus Men. 888.

50. The nominative diui = di occurs only here in Plautus ς but the
formula diuom atque hominum fidem is repeatedly found, Amph. v 1, 69.
Aul. 297. Mero, 842. Rud. prol. 9.—adaaeim is said by Nonius to be
>the same as adigamt, an explanation which renders only the general
sense of the word, but does not account for its formation. This is ex-
plained by Festus’ remark (u. aaeitiosi) ‘ amit antiquos dixisse pro
eqerit manifestum est? axim 16 formed in the same way as faxim, for
which see Key, L. G. ξ 566. Α third formation of the same kind is
capsim capsis, which was already misunderstood for cape eis (ei uie) by
Cicero Or. § 154. The perfects axi (ay-si), faxi (fac-si), cap-si follow
the analogy of dumi (duc-si) rep-si etc.‚ while &qi feci cepi lengthen the
radical vowel. See Gorssen, loric. beitr. καθ’ lat. formenl. p. 530.

52. Such alliterations as scelesta sola sectam are very frequently
found in the ancient Roman poete and deserve our especial attention.
We shall here point out only a few examples which occur in the next
lines: dedoem discipulam 59. metuo male 61. miseram modis 66.
miseram-modwn 69. depies die 70. --Alliteration was, it is true, never

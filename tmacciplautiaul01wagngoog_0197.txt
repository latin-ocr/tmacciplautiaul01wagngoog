EXEGETIGAL COMMENTARY. 1 O 7

1v 3, 54. Plaut. Epid. in fine: hio ie homost qui libertatem malitia
¹ inuenit sua. Cicero too has the word in this sense, ad Act. xv 26.-
Instead of omni, Oicero would have preferred ulla: see Parry's note on
Ter. Andr. 11 3, 17.-εἱηο omni malitiast Trin. 338.

214. For ase-bitror comp. Cas. 11 4, 5 bonae fmqi hominem ιὲ iam
pridem 0580 wbitror: :intelle-qo, and see Introd. p. :tm—aurum kuic olet]
We think the following extract from Prof. Key' s paper ‘ on the word
Inklinq’ not out of place here. ‘A faint suspicion about anything lan-
guage is apt to represent under a figure borrowed from the sense of
small. Thus subolet mihi is the favourite mode of expressing this idea
with Plautus and Terence [oboluit kuic matr-sumum Men. 3841. The
medium ΒΥ which the scent is conveyed is of course the air, and thus we
have the phrase ‘ to wind,' meaning ‘to catch a scent of anything‚’ 50
’ 5150 ‘to get wind of,’ or as the Germans say wind damon haben?

215. For the prolepsis see note on v. 440.

216. Formulas of this kind were usual on such occasions as this:
see v, 780.

218. facinus facere] Plautus makes frequent use of the so-called
fiqura etymoloqica, 0. g. this very phrase occurs again Cure. 1 1, 24.
Cicero too has it, de fin. 11 29, 95, most probably' 111 consequence of a re-
membrance from some poet. Oomp. Prin. 446. 599.

219. ‘A poor man, who never gave offence to you or yours,'
(Thermon). For abs 500 ΚοΥ, L. G. ξ 1303 0, and note on v. 184.

220. For the construction mereri ut Brix on Capt. 419 quotes the
following passages: Cape. 419. 740. Epid. v 2, 47. Ter. Andr. 1 5, 46.
Cic. de or. 1 54, 232. Liv. xr. 11.

225. item never has the sense attributed to it by Hildyard ‘ on the
other hand,’ and the passage quoted by him (Aul. prol. 20) very well
admits of the common sense of the word. Ι have therefore adopted
Brix’ s emendation of this passage. ——Forsactiosum see note on v. 165. .

226. locassim is explained by Oorssen, ausepr. 2, 37. It arises
from 511 original form locauesim (from which the common form locauerim
is derived with the change of an 8 into an r); ΒΥ 5 compression of the
middle syllables we get loca-sim or locassim (comp. cauea caussa and
Introd. p. XLI). In a similar way we have ara-980 = wauieo araeo (Key,
L. G. ὃ 567) ——locare is frequently used ΒΥ the comio pocts where later
writers would have said conlocare .· 500 the examples given by Bentley

‘ in his note 011 Ter. Phorm. v 1, 32.

228. The words onus onustus onerare are in the best MSS. fre-
quently spelt with an initial Ιι. Prof. Key (‘Alphabet’ p. 68) connects
honor and (monus as being of the same origin, both being derived from
5 root Ῐιοη, denoting a load or charqe, which is either an honor or a bur·

contained in this volume seem to have been already thrown together in
Oasley's time, though the present splendid binding bears the date of the
year 1757. As regards the age of the MS„ Ι may add that Bentley
attributes it to the tenth century 3 but there he is undoubtedly wrong.
That Bentley knew the MS„ was very probable, sinoe he was ‘Library
keeper to His Majesty¹' and his studies on the ancient comio writers
gave him ample opportunity of consulting such a curicus ΜΒ. Ι have,
therefore, no doubt that Bentley means our ΜΒ. when, speaking in his
note on Ter. Haut. tim. 1 1, 20 about the line in the Aulularia which
in the present edition is 241, but which in the ΜΒΒ. stands after v. 390'
(= 11 8, 23), he says, ‘ Propere a pluribus Codd. abest, ut a Reqio 800
annorum. Lege: Nimirum occidor, ni intro huc propero currere? The
word in question is actually omitted in J (a fact of which we shall have
to speak presently) and there neither is nor was any other MS. of Plautus

in the King’s Library which can claim an age of 800 years. Ι may
observe that Bentley, however, did not hold this ΜΒ. to be the oldest
source for the text of Plautus. In a note on Ter. Andr. 1v 3, 13 he
quotes a line from the Cistellarii 11 1, 25 ‘Abi quaerere ubi tuo iurando
motata aa mesia& adding ‘lca codex omnium uetera-imus: and this is actu-
ally the reading of B'. In J we find it thus ‘Abi querere ubi luo iurando
satie eil subsidii‚’ i. e. J agrees here with Gruter‘s fourth Palatino ΜΒ.
The eight comedies contained in this ΜΒ. are arranged in the same
order which we find in B: Amphitruo Asinaria Aulularia Captiui
Curculio Casina Cistellaria Epidicus, which ends fol. 19412, so that the

Plautian ΜΒ. alone consiste of 81 leaves. The space left on fol. 194· is
filled with the following lines:

Exemplar mendum tandem me compulit ipsu
Cunctantem nimiu planta exemplarier istu.—
Ne graspicus⁸ mendis epprias idiota teptis

Adderet. a liber hic falso patre falsior essen

These verses, bad as they are, would still lead to the presumption that
the ΜΒ. with which we have to deal, was not a mere imitation, but a

¹ So he calls himself on the title-page of the Dissertation upon the Epistles of
Phalaris, London‚ 1679.

² Bentley neglects the spelling querere.
⁸ Our poet (if it be not too much honour to call him so) means, of course,
amphione, and this he takes in the sense of scriba or librarius.

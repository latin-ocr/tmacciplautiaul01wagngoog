All these forms ocem· in the metres of the comio writers: we must,
however, leave it to the industry of om· readers to collect as many
examples of each separate measure as they find sufficient fin· their mm
conviction„ Many instances of the varied metrical character of ei are
collected by Ritschl‚ de armamentis metricis sab. Plaut. (Bonnae 1841)
p. 10 ss. ‚

We shall now briefly enumerate some of the most fmquent cases
in which i and u display their variable nature. Thus we have

dies = dyas, die = dyc,

diu = ἅμα,

scio = segle,

ais ain ait' as monosyllableS,

aibam etc. as disyllables,

trium = tmyum,

otio filio qaudiis omnia tertiust nescio as disyllables.

On the other hand it should be observed that qratiis and in·
qratiis in Plautus and Terence are always fully pronounced ,· in later
times we find qratis and inqratis as the predominant forms.

In tuos and suo-3¹ and their various forms the u assumes in many
instances the consonantal sound of a v. The same is the case with
many words where a u follows an initial consonant, e. g. duo (dum-am
dumam duobus duabus) duellum² duellica puer puella, or in such an
instance as quattor for quattuor ⁸.

The verbal forms fui futhei fuistis fuisse, dte. undergo very osten a
synizesis of the two letters ui. fui and fait may, however, be pro-
nounced in three different ways, viz. fiii fili fi‘c} (monosyll.). If we add
the variable quantity of the perfect termination ‘it (see p. xlx), we
arrive at the following possible pronunciations offuit:

filit filit filit filit sz‘dt (monos).

² tuus and suus are not only not Plautian, but not even good Latin forms. Even

Cicero knows no uu. (In fluuius the first u is the root vowel, the second a modifi-
cation of the guttural 9.)

² 'I'he pronunciation avellum was the next - precursor to the secundary form
bellum. In the same way we have duonum (dvonum) bonum.

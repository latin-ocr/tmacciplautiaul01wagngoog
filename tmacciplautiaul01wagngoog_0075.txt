To proceed‚ Ritscbl allows no such hiatus as we have Prin. 185
em mea malefacta, em meam auaritiam tibi
according 10 1110 reading of all our MSS. He writes therefore
en mea malefacta, meam en auaritiam tibi
1ο which Fleckeisen just-,ly prefers Hermann’s reading

en mea tibi malefacta, en meam auaritiam tibi.

Or to give another instance, Tm’n. 776 the reading of all our MSS.

is as follows:

det alteram mi, alteram dicat tibi

which Bitschl changes into
illi det alteram,· alteram (1100111111.

In both cases 1110 last editor of 1110 Trinummus‚ Mr Brix‚ has kept
the reading of the MSS„ and we think him 1110 more 0111111οᾱ to do so,
as ,11 requires a great deal of arbitrary criticism 10 0011001 all 011101·
1110100000 of the same kind. We hold therefore the reading of the MSS.
to be genuine in 1110 following linesfrom the Aulularia:

695. memorare nolo, h6minum¹ mendicabula.
561. potare ego hodie, Eficlio ², tecum 11010.
704. atat, eccum 1Ρο11111.11>0, 1111100 (10οᾱ0111, (1011111111.

And I have 10 blame myself for correct-,ing the MS. reading in

v. 671 .

“ Indeque obseruabo, asu-um ubi abstrudat senex.
We have the same hiatus v. 69

queo conminisci: sta me miseram ad hsme modum

¹ Some scholare, 1ο avoid 1110 hiatus, would write homonum. See Studemnnd,

Jahrb. silr class. phil. 1866 p. 61. and Fleckeisen, ibid. Ρ. ’7.
² It would be possible to read hodie potare eqo, Euclio, tecam uolo. —A hiatus of
the same ldnd (i. 0. before a proper name) occurs Peon. v 3, 8: ·

0 mi ere 001110,Η6,11110 insperatissume.

This 1s 1110 reading m Bc, and though A gives the scene in which this line stands,
I cannot say what the reading in it is. But 10 show how easy it is 10 get rid 01
011011 a hiatus as this, if we only are determined 10 (10 so, we will remove it for the

benefit of 1110 hiatus-haters among our readers:
0 1111 ere‚sa1ue:3alue Hanno insperatissume.

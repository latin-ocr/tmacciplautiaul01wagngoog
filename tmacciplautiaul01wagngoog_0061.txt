The second class of our instances of violated quantity will be divided
into two sections: l. violation of quantity in vowels naturally long 5
2. violation of quantity in vowels long by position.

l. Under this head we have to mention some very strong cases 3 but
it may be premised that, in almost every separate instance, some editor
or other tries to remedy such offensive violations of regular quantity
either by transposition or some kind of alteration of the text, i.e. by
admitting a kind of criticism which may have its , justification if the
case in question should be quite isolated, but which must be entirely
discarded if the multitude of ·analogous instances defles correction. We
simply put some instances together and let them plead for themselves.

The e in an imperfect of the second conj ugation is shortened in the
following line:

,quid ad me ibatis? ridiculum uerthfimini.
Ter. Phorm. v 8, 8.¹

Bentley might well call this an ‘ indiqna et turpia licentia,' because·
he was not awa-re of the general law which accounts for the shortened θ’.

In Plautus the word Acheruns generally occurs with a long a, and
therefore, as Bit-sch] observes ‘ ‘non produci breuis syllaba dicenda est in
Acheruns per Plautinae fabulas nouem, sed lonya corripi in Poenulo?
(Proll. Prin. cnxxl). The passages alluded to by Ritschl are: ⁶

ipse abiit ad Xcherfintem sine uiatico Poen. prol. 71.
quo die' Orcus ab Kcherunte mortuos amiserit ibid. 1 2, 131,
quoduis genus ibi hominum uidem, quasi {cheruntem ueneris ibid. ιν 2, 9.

to which or'ain (plaut. stud. p. 16) adds a line from the Mostellaria
(5092

ninom me accersunt ad {cheruntem mortui

We have here four instances of a rhythmical shortenin g of a vowel
which is in all other instances long. That this same vowel is always

short in the usage of later poete, is no doubt due to the adoption of the
quantity 'of the Greek word ².

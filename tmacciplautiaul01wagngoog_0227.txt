The laterna Punica is only here mentioned3 Weise says ‘ forte e uitro
facta ι’ and this opinion seems not quite without foundation, when we
· consider that the invention of glass is generally ascribed to the Phoe-
nicians.—Beaumont and Fletcher, poets who like to show their learning,
manifestly imitate this passage in ‘ The Scornful Lady’ 11 3 p. 301 ed.
Lond. 1750: ‘ Serv. Yonder's a cast of coach-mares of the gentlewoman's,
the strangest cattle. Wel. Why‘z Serv. Why, they are transparent,
sir, you may see through them!

559. ‘ Qui opus aliquod, hoo est materiam aliquam efformandam
effingendam elaborandam alicui tradit, is locare: conducere uero qui illud
opus suscipiat, dicitnr? Lindemann on Capt. 1v 2, 39. conducere is here
simply ιο buy, locare in the next line ιο put out. Euclio plays upon the
word locare which would remind every one of the phrase sunus locare
‹to contract with an undertaker about a funeral.’ This becomes the
more pungent, as Euclio advises Megadorus to bespeak the lamb's fune-
ral while it is still alive.

562. The future perf. iussero stands here, as often in the comio
writers, for the simple future iubebo or rather the subj. perf. iusserim:

563. On Ter. Andr. 1 1, 91 forle unam ‘aspicio adulescentulam Do-
natus observes ‘ ex consuetudine (i. e. from the conversational style, the
συνήθεια, as the Greek grammarians say) dica unam, ut dicimus
unus est adulescens. tolle unam, οι ita fiet ut sensui nihil desit...umm
pro quadam) This is, in other words, that in the conversational lan·
guage of the Romans unus has sometimes the place of the indefinite article
of modern languages. Guyet, Westerhov and Ruhnken on the passage
in Terence give several instances of this fact 3 for Plautus see Amph. 11
2, 74. Uist. 1v 2, 70. As. 111 1, 13. Most. 691. Olor. 24. Truc. 11 1, 39:
in the same way we find unus used asan article by Petron. 26 p. 28
Biich. But it may be observed th at nearly all the Plautian passages
would also admit of a more exact explanation in which umus would still
have some meaning beyond a mere indefinite article: thus we might
here explain cadum unum ‘ only one bottle'——a me = a mea domo: in
the same way we have> a nobis ‘from our house' Glor. 339, and both to-
gether a nobis demost Oist. 1v 1, 6.

565. madidus and the Greek βεβρεγμένος often mean ‘ drunk,' e. g.

lxii mmommnon.

- as the line stands not only in J γ and the recent MSS„ but in Β itanu·
(see Addenda).

Two other instances which might be alleged, are doubtful. The
first is v. 504,

stat sufflo phrugio aurifex linarias.

In this case we may notice that B gives phyr9i0‚ a reading which
could be supporbed by a great many analogous examples of other
words ¹, though it is true that this form of the word seems to occur
nowhere else. If therefore we could confidently say that a hiatus was in
this line an impossibility‚ we should have to give phua-950 in our text.

In v. 44 we have other reasons which lead us to presumo that some ’

word was omitted in B. See critical note.
In the caesura ἔφθημιμερής Ritsohl allows a hiatus Pseud. 1079:

set conuenistine hominem :z immo amb68 simul

because the line is divided among two speakers. This is the same case
as Aue. 562:

non potem 036² quidem hercle :: at ego iussero.

And in accordance 'with this Ι have venturetl to give the reading of
the MSS. v. 111:

nam non est ueri simile, hominem⁸ pauperem

though it is easy to transpose ueri simile ηὸτι est.

But there is a general law which protects a great many passages in
Plautus in which a hiatus occurs, from the corrections of modern scholars.
We owe its discovery to Prof. Fleckeisen. It is as follows:

All monosyllabae termiminq in a lonq vowel or m need not coaleeoe
with a so llowinq skort vowel.

Illustrations of this law will be seen in such passages as Stich.
321. Aul. 7 07. 708. Glor. 1330.

P ⁸ Bitschl would not admit 296 in an iambic line ‘nisi ubi pausa fit uocis αεὶ

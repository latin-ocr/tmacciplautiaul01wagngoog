Cicero. See Gorssen‚ ausepr. 1, 49. We see therefore that the abuse of
the letter 12. is not only confined to modern times, but dates from vene-
rable antiquity. (The knowledge of the weak pronunciation of the h con-
tributes to make the pun more palpable Glor. 34 ‘auribus perhauriundae
sunt.’)—illuo sis ‘ further off, if you please.' This sis is an equivalent to
si uis, conf Cic. or. 45, 154. ‘lubenter uerba iunqebant‚ ut sodes pro si
audes, sis pro si uis.' sodes is perhaps the genuine reading v. 168, 888
crit. note. Prof. Key, L. G. § 1361, considers Cicero’s statement to be
wrong with regard to sodes, which he proposes to derive from si uoles,
l and d being interchanged. But Ι should not hesitate to accept
Cicero’s derivation, on account of such Plautian passages as Truc. 11 4,
71 non audes aliquod dafre mihi munusculum? ‘won’t you give me a
nice little present 'l' Men. 149 ecquid audes de tuo istuc addere? Asin.
11 4, 70 nou audes mila· subuenire? Pseud. 7 8 nilne adiuuare me

audes 2 Pseud. 1317 non audes, quaeso, aliquam partem milii qratiam
facere huius arqenti? Trin. 244 da mila· hoo, mel meum, si me amas, si
audes (such is the express reading of the MSS). It is true that in all
these passages audere does not entirely lose its original meaning, but
this is very much weakened¹ a'nd modified so that the word almost
assumes the sense to have a mind to—, which prevails in sodes. There
is still another ‚objection which I have to Prof. Key’s derivation, viz.
the length of the o in sodes, which would be left unexplained‚ if the
word were vreally contracted from si uoles, for uo could not be con-
tracted to ὃ. We must not wonder at the politeness which Euclio
displays in spite of his wrath, in using the particle sis. It is a curious
fact that very often our politeness especially to inferiors increases in

proportion to our wrath.
47. For incedit see Introd. p. va. incedit is more than ‘she walks‚’

it is ‘ she creeps. ' ‘incedere est otiose et cum dignitate quadam ambu-
lantium) Westerhov on Ter. Eun. v 3, 9, who qutifes Plaut. Pseud.
411 and Verg. Aen. 1 46. Ruhnken adds Propert. 11 2, 6 with
Broukhuys’ note.

48. hercle logically belongs to the following line, but in conse-

quence of a kind of hasty anticipation it is put into the protasis. We
find it is so very often, e.g. v. 56. 248. Pseud. 628. Stich. 610. Trin-

457 . Epid. 111 1, 10. Ι11 all these passages hercle immediately follows

si, and perhaps we should here follow Hare’s conjecture in changing
the order of the words si hodie hercle into si hercle hodie, although this

transposition is not strictly necessa* “¹³6 and Introd. p. x.

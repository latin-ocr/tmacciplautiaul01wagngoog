similar contracted pronunciation of θεὰς and· Occi, which is not unfre-
quently met with in the tragic poets.

The word meus was treated much in the same way as deus: we have
therefore mei mac mco meos meas mei-3 sometimes as monosyllableS, and
meorum mearum as disyllables ¹. The real pronunciation of these forms·
in such cases may be ascertained from the spelling micis (ἐπιθῶ) which
occurs in the dactylic inscription on the sepulchre of one of the Scipios:
this enables us to guess that it was probably very much like the modern'
Greek pronunciation of θιός (= θεὰς), i.e. myas dyo, dvc.

Many forms of the pronouns ie and idem fall under the same head 3

{cidem (abl.) Erum. The subj unctives. eTtmus e—atis appear as disyllables
according to the same rule, and in eme—imdum (Aul. 40) we notice the
same pronunciation. .

The forms eius ei huius (huic) quoius quoi deserve special notice.
Of these, quoi and huic are always ‘monosyllablesg while the others
admit of a triple pronunciation:

trochee‚ pyrrhich, monosyllable, γ

’ e‘zus' &ius⁸ effic = cis
Ιιῖνιιε* huius‘ ῘιιιιΤιε -- 'zuis‘
qum—us cilius quo-270⁸ = quoi-9⁵
emus ⁹ cuz-223 = cuis
εἰ ἔτί ’ἑὶσ

¹ For the forms dius and mius see Ritsch1‚ de decl. quadam lat. recond. 1 p. 22.
⁴ ² Ι purposely do not mention the oldest forms e-i-us ho-i-us quo-t-us (tit. Scip.
Barb. Bitschl. pr. l. m. ep. t. 37), since they are not found in Plautus and Terence.

⁸ Το this head we may refer the examples quoted above p. xlviii. See Lach-
mann,⁸ comm. Lucr. p. 27. and especially p. 160 s. ’

⁴ The spelling huis occurs in an inscription in Gruter's collection 44, 3: see
Gorssen, krit. beitr. κατ’ lat. formenl. p. 545. In Guyet's edition of Plautus the
forms eis huis and quoi-³ are several times found in the text.

⁵ This pronunciation must be assumed for a line of Lucilius: quoius uoltu ac
facie, ludo ac semonibm nostris. (Lachmann, l. l.) Lachmann shows that this form
left its traces in cuicuimodi i. e. quoisquoismodi‚ the dropping oi the final ε taking
place as explained above p. xxxi. The u disappeared much in the same way as παρὰ
presupposes an original magius (Coi-seen, amspr. 2, 192). The oldest MS. gives
cuicuiusmodi in Oic. Verr. v 41, 107 which Halm is inclined to believe genuine.
J ⁶ It is quite the same with rei, νόἱ, τε (=r?t); spei epti *spe (παρῆ) sco. See
note on Aul. 607.

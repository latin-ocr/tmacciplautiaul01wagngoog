148 8180811011. COMMENTARY.

Ter. Eun. lv 3, 11 Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quac turbas dedic.—
oolu‘nt ‘ inhabitz’ see 011 v. 4.

694. The joy in which Strobilus is makes his words somewhat in-
coherent. He says reyes ceteros, though he has not yet mentioned the
name of any king whose wealth might be compared to his. This has
already been pointed out by Lambinus—We cannot think here of kinq
Picus (Preller‚ rom. myth. p. 331 ss.) because we have Pici in the plural.
—istos ‘ those commonly admired.'

695. Nonius is undoubtedly wrong in using the word mendicatio
for 1116 explanation of mendicabulum: the pfflsage itself shows that we
should translate ‘ beggarly follows? Appuleius has the same expression
in two passages, and in both 116 applies it to persona—For the hiatus
see Introd. p. mn. The emendation requm mendicabula (‘ beggarly king·

⁶ lets‘) which is found in Guyet's text, seems due to Scipio Gentilis, as

appears from Taubmann’s note.

696. ille ‘the renowned' See 11016 011 v. 86.

698. Τ116 construction conlocare in aliquid is not classic, but by no
’ means scarce. See 1116 dictionaries 8. v. Men. 986 in tabernam uasa

ct seruos conlocaui. Plautus has also ponere in aliquid, 6. g. Trin. 739.
Rud. 1v 7 , 11.

699. For indeque see Introd. p. xtv.

700. Ι11 deorsum the e is to be elided before 1116 0.· 866 Introd. p. 1211.

701. The form exfodio occurs again in the best MSS. in Glor. 315.
The common Plautian form is ecfodio (v. 53). EXFOCION T (i.e. exfla-
9iunt) occurs in the inscription 011 1116 so-called ‘ columna rostrata’
Oomp. exv-ducier (Bc) Truc. v 5, 16. exmiqracti (B) Men. 822.

702. Τ116 first syllable in ille (ile) is short (Introd. p. xul).

704. ‘ Atat pro poetae lubitu uariat suum tonum: nunc duat, nunc
abaetat, nune atdt: quod postremum hoc loco placet.' Bentley on Ter.
Andr. 1 1, 98.

705 88. Μο11616’8 masterly imitation of this scene should be com·
pared with Plautus, though it is difficult to decide which is better, 1116
original or 1116 imitation—For occidi see Introd. p. xxvm. This quan-
tity would however not occur in iambics or trochaica—For tene? 16πὲ 866
Introd. p. xxvn.

706. For the hiatus quo· e— see Introd. p. mm. The same hiatus
occurs v, 708 qui e·—

7 07. With 1116 expression cwm animo inuectiqare comp. Plaut. Most.
702 coquo cum mco animo,

709. 0116 of the French translators of Plautus thinks it ‘une malico
tres-fine' that Plautus 1618 Ε110110 address the spectators as if 1116 thies
was among them. Tastes may of course differ on such points as this;

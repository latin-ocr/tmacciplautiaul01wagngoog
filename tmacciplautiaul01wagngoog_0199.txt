‚ 241. On this line see crit. note and Introd. 'p. 1v ⁴and x'1. Φ
242. The infin. act. confodere ‚is to be explained by supposing the
ellipsis of an aecus, like seruos. Hildyard justly compares the following
passages from Virgil: Aen. 11 185—6. 111 472. v 385. 773. This negli-·
gent construction is very frequent after iubeo: see the examples given
by» Zumpt ἕ 617. Bothe, however, writes confodiri, in which case we-
should pronounce αμα (see Introd. p. xxxlv). For the irregular form of
the infinitivo comp. Glor. 37 4 non possunt mihi minis tuis hisce oculis
exfodiri, where the Ambrosian palimpsest has Exromm, while the other
MSS. give fodiri (see Bitschl, rhein. mm. 11 159). There is however
not sufficient reason to adopt this form in the present passage—It was
very rash of me to write hinc eit according to Pareus’ statement of the
reading in B. If we may tr'ust Gruter, the MS. has ltine ἔ (⁴6 cum uir-
gula superiacente'), and this would be hinc est. It is very possible that
this is the* genuine reading, so that we should have to explain ltine by a'
σύγχυσις of two constructions: quo hinc vluit et ubi est. The reading hie
est, would, of course, be easier to understand. eit is, at all eventa an
impossibility.

248. For hercle see note on V. ‹is—The ,verb elinquare occurs only
in this passage and in the treatise de differentiis uerborum by Cornelius
Fronto (p. 2200 Putsch) ‘elinquis habet linguam, sed usu eius caret:
elinquatus amisit.’ Comp. also elinquatio γλωσσοτομία and elinque, as

as usque ad. Terence has it only once, Plcorm. 11 3, 48.

the conjunction que see Key‚ L. G. ξ 1436. For looes see note on

250. For the hiatus arbitrari: Eziclio comp. v. 174 and Introd. p. Lx.

251. In senecta aetas the first word is to be considered as an adjec-
tive, see Brix on Trin. 43. aetate iuenta (i. e. iau.) occurs in the end of
a' hexameter in an old inscription: Ritschl‚ P. L. M. E. tab. 80, c.
Terence has senecta alone Ad. v 8, 313 in all other passages he uses

senectus—ludos facere: ludere, lude-ficari, and hence we should explain
the construction c. acc. (see an analogous case v. 194 s.). Plautus has
this phrase with the dative just as well (Mero. 11 1,1. Rud. 111 1,1.
Tmc.1v 2, 46. Most. 111, 80. Cas. 1v 1, 3), but still the accusative is
more frequent. See Ritsohl, Par. 1 428, where a special paper on „this

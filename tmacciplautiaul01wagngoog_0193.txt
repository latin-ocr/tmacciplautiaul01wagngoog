mann (see p. mvn), that the MS. Β reads deminuam, not diminuam, as
my text gives in consequence of the carelessness of former collations.
And this is no doubt the genuine reading, comp. the only other Plautian
passage in which this word occurs, Truc. 11 7, 10 (= 558 Geppert) mim
de hoc obsoudcu de mina uua deminui modo Quinque nummos, where
deminui is the reading of all the MSS.—diminuo or diwmniiiuo (this is the
spelling found in Β Meu. 304 and Most. 265) is quite a different word}
its original composition with dis- manifests itself in the phrases dimmi-
nuere caput (Plaut. Meu. 304. Most. 265. Ter. Eun. 803) and cerebrum
(Ter. Ad. 571). The difference between compounds of de and die· has
only been overlooked: thus we have describere ‘to describe' and discribere
‘ to divide‚' see Biicheler, rhein. ‘mua xm 598 ss. and jahrb. fiir class.
phil. 1863 p. 782 s.; for dispicere and despicere see M unro’s critical note
on Lucr. 1v 419. diminuo itself frequently stands where the genuine
form would be deminuo: see Lachmann on Lucr. v 266 p. 237.—F0r

164. The same expressions are used Prin. 346 and the whole linc
appears again Οαφι. 321, where it is however considered spurious by
Fleckeisen and Brix. .

165. For factio see Nonius as quoted in the critical notes, and such
passages as Triu. 452. 464. 497. Cistell. 11 1, 17 . The adjective fac÷
tioeus (v. 225) means therefore ‘ multis innixus et florens clientelis.’—
dotis] The gen. plur. dotium occurs Digest. xxm 3 ‘ de iure dotium’—
dapsilis = δαψιλής. dapsilue is no Latin form: the passage generally
quoted, Pseud. 396, is too corrupt to prove anything. The adverb
dapsile'is read in a fragment of Pomponius (v. 161. Gom. Ribb. p. 210).

168. For sodes (Priscian’s reading) see note on v. ‹ie—quis· east]

⁸0⁶ (171οῨ. 11136356 or haud is the form given by the MSS. Throughout the

Aulularia the true Plautian form of this word before consonants would
be hau: see Ritschl‚ proli. Prin. p. x01x. praef Stichi p. XVI. Fleckeisen,
ep. mit. p. x. ’ This same form repeatedly occurs in the MSS. of Livy
and Tacitus, and grammarians tell us that virgil used it: see Fleckeisen,

P 172. quid dictura 's i. 6. dictura es, though we should expect either
eis or quod es dictura. But in Plautian language the difference between
the subjunctive and indicative in constructions like the present is not
yet accurately developed. We may compare Bacch. 78 scio eqo quid
ayo ι :at eqo pol scio quid metuo with Aul. 106 sed quid aqam scio,

her assent with the words generally used on such occasions di bene uor-

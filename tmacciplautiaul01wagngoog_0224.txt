thrwm (i. e. the Greek διάβαθρον) 16 quoted from Naevius by Varro.

509. solem-ius occurs only here and Gruter 648, 13 3 molocinarius
(or moloch.) here and in an inscription Muratori 939, 6. Ι 6111 now in-
clined to consider this line as spurious: for, first of all, why should the
solem-ii be named after the &abatem-ii? and then, how could the poet
name solearii and molocinarii, members of very different profession& in
one and the same breath? ,

510. In this 11116 1116 two professione which mend old gai-ments are

richer classes which possessed more lauded property: and accordingly

perty? K oepke. See also Varro as quoted in the critical notes. The

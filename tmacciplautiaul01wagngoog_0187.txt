Munro says (on -Lucn 1 136), that the idiom is not confined to animi,
-and thus strongly speak against Professor Key’s hypothesis,

106. secl is necessary on account of nam in the following line. Eu· -

his reason for doing s0. This reason is given by nam.

’ 107. Vtrum leyitimos habent omnes tribue diuisores suos, quos
Plautus maqisbros curiarum in Aulularia uocat 2 is the question raised
⁴by Asconius on Cic. Verr. 1 8, 23, although there is no serious founda-
tion for it, the diuisores being no legally authorised persons, but distri-
butors of bribery money. See Long's note and cic. pro Plancio 19, 48.
We may however remark that the expression maqister‘ curiae is a ἅπαξ
λεγόμενον, and was doubtless meant as a translation of the τριττυιίρχης
'of the Greek original (see de Aul. p. 15). The whole passage treats of
Athenian life: distributions of money were very frequent at Athens, but
almost unknown at Rome before the time of the emperors

108. nummus ‘ has, a different sense in Plautus according as it
means Greek or Roman money. As a Roman coin, it is equivalent to
a sestertius (Epid. 1 1, 52. Most. 11 l, 10): in the other case to a drachma
(To-in. 844) or didrachma (To-ac. 11 7, 10. Pseud. 111 2, 20. Pers. 1 l,
38. 111 3, 33. v 2, 70). It is impossible to decide whether drachma or
didrachma be meant in such=passages as Aul. 445. Men. 1 4, 1. 11 2
16. Epid. 1112, 363 nor is it clear whether drachma or sestertius should
be understood Epid. v 2, 36. As drachma the word is taken by Bentley
in Ter. IIaut. tim. 111 3, 45. Where aureus is added, the nummus Plu:-
uppem is meant) Brea on Tria. 844.-2·n uiros, κατ’ ἄνδρας, uiritim.

114. beniqnius salutant ‘ they are more profuse in their compli-
ments.' Gomp. Hor. ep. 1, 5, 11 sermome benique ‘ eopious, plentiful
talk! See also od. 1 17, 15. 11 18, 10. In most cases, where we are·
generally inclined to translate beniqnue by ‘ kind‚' the original sense of
the word ‘ generous‚ profuse’ wiu give a more distinct and impressive
idea of the meaning of the passage.

*nota mosam-vm neutro ρατιονε dici) and indeed Plautus uses this word

as neuter throughout the Trinummus (see Fleckeisen, ep. crit. p. xl).
v'But in this prologue it is doubtless masculine,- see v. 12. In the play
'itself it would seem to be neuter in one passage, but even this admits of
'another explanation. Se'e v. 265.

13. Oomp. Hor. Sco-m. 11 6, 1 hoc orat in uotis: modus aya-0· non
*ita magnus.

Γ 18. inpendio is here used as an adverb. Cicero has it so in his
epistles, ad Ate. x 4, 9 at ille inpendio nunc maqic odit senatum. See
'Afranius 352 (Ribb. Com. p. 179) indice inpendio Ι ex disiderio mdyie
maqieque maceror, and Ter. Emi. 111 5, 39 inpendio mayis animus qaa-
*dcbat mihi.

.' 19. The a in such compounds as impartio dimna-tio διο. has, as
regards the Plautian MSS„ not the same authority as c, the latter
being generally supported by MSS. of a higher character. See p. lxv„
’ 23. For mila see Introd. p. xxv. ——- cotidie, instead of quotidie, is a
form well supported* by the best MSS. and expressly recommended by
Marius Victorinus 1 p. 2460 (Putsch). Evon the spelling cottidie
which we occasionally find in B, may be defended by some inscriptions,
e. g. Orelli-Henzen n0. 5593, and prevails in the old palimpsest of
Gaius: see Oorssen, ausspr. 1, 69. As regards the quantity of this
word, it is always quotidie quotidiamus; the quantity quotidianus is
assumed from a corrupt passage, Cat. 68, 139 where Iachmann reads
concoquit iram (the depravation arose no doubt from the spelling con-
quoquit, for which see note on 344).

24. tus uinum coronae were the usual honours offered to the house-
hold-gods: see v. 383 and the commentators upon Hor. od. 111 23, 3.
qu. 1x 137 ss.

25. Oomp. huius honoris qratia Amph. 1 2, 24.

27. After having given the yeneral reason of his action, the Lar is
now going to inform his hearers of the detailcd circumstances. This
is the true explanation of nam, a particle which never gives up its
character entirely, though it may seem simply connective in some
passages. The Greek γάρ is osten used in exactly the same way. See
note on v. 595.

30. neque autem (‘ nor on the other hand’) is used by Cicero
Fam. v 12 and Lucretius v1 779. The scribes of the Langian MSS.
did not understand autem and replaced it therefore by the bold conjec-
ture autumat, which however spoils the metrc.

31. his senex de proxumo (ex prox. 169. 288) ‘the old man, our
neighbour.' , He means Megadorus. ·

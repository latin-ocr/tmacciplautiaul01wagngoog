xxxviii mrnonucnon.

si tu ad legionem bellator clfies, at in culina ego.
Truc. 11 7, 54 (=6o4 G.)

Another instance of the same kind is Ῐιαῦἔε Aul. 185 and Pseud. 161.

5. In the satne way the ending ῖε in the dative and ablativa plural
of nouns and in the present of verbs is occasionally shortened:

ex graecis benis latinas fecit nen bonas' ·
” ’ Ter. Eun. prol. 9.

ques penes mei ffiit potestas, benis meis quid foret et meae uitae
Trin. 822 ².

bonis esse oportet dentibus lenem probam ε adridere
Truc. 1, 14 (=226 G.)

satin siquis amat, nequit qum nili sit atque inprobis ertibue se expoliat.
Truc. 11 7, 2 (=549 G.)

uiris cum summis, inclutae amicae
Pseud. ‚174.

multis ssim modis circumuentus . . . .
Ennius (ed. Vahlen p. 96, Ribb. Trag. p. 15.)

is me scelus auro usque attondit dolie dectis indoctum fit lubitumst
Bacch. 1095 .

at pel ego abs te conoessero z: iamne abia? bene ambuleto
Persa 50.

peregre quoniam aduenis, cena datur.
rme. 1 2, 28 (=129 e.)
The last instance should be explained from the simple form uenis,
which would, of course, fall under the general rule-
A very strong instance of a shortened final syllable occurs in the
Bacchides (48):

poteris agere ε atque is dum ueniat, sedens ibi opperfbere.

For even if we allow that an n before an 8 disappears in many
instanoes, the long quantity of the e would still romain ‚unalteredt yet
we must here admit a short pronunciation of the syllable em. Bitschl
changes the reading of the MSS. by transposing atque ibi eedem, dum ie
ueniat, oppeoibere. Fleckeisen is true to the authority of the MSS. ,

All these short quantities are, of course, of but occasional occur-
rence 3 but they suffice to show the large extension of a very dangerous
propensity of the Latin language in Plautus’ time, which was fast

¹ meis and meae should be pronounced as monosyllables.
¹ This is the reading 01 the MSS. adhered to in Fleckeisen’s edition.

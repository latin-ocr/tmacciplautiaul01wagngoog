A. ARCHAIO LONG VOWELS.

In its most remote period, the Latin language was overburdened
with long and heavy vowels. Some of these archaic long vowels are
occasionally found even in later writers, but a great many of them
appear still in Plautus and his contemporaries. They are, however, of
rare occurrence in Terence, nay, some of them seem to have been
entirely lost in the period between Plautus and Terence. In the fol-
lowing pages, all such lengthened vowels are mentioned as concern
Plautus: but before undertaking their perusal, the reader must be
cautioned against the opinion that Plautus always uses the syllables
mentioned with the same (and no other) quantity 3 on the contrary, in
his writings he assumes the greatest licence to treat them just as it is
best for the verse. This is, of course, a great convenience for the poet,
but sometimes very inconvenient to his reader.

1. In deden-vion we find the following deviatione from the common
usage of the Augustan period:

a in the nom. and voc. sing. of the first declension was principally
long in old Latin, as it is indeed in Sanskrit and in most cases of the
Greek. That it must have been so, might, even in default of other
proofs‚ have been concluded from the simple fact that the genitive ᾶϊ
would be left unaccounted for, if it was not for the length of the nom. a.
(Bitschl, rhein. mus. xlv 400). But we really find it long in three
lines of the old inscriptions on the sepulchres of the Scipios.

honos sama uirtusque gloria atque ingenium

terra Pubu prognatum Publio Corneli.
quoie1 uita defecit, non honos honore.

(Ritschl, ibid.) Nay‚ Biicheler shows (jahrbilckerfizr classi-volte philoloqie
1863 p. 336 s.) that in all the ‘Saturnians which we have, the nom. and

pulit’ (Alphabet p. 146), there being no metrical reason at all, why we should not
admit a dactyl -Φν (prim dni) instead of the spondes prim am. 1 am afraid that
a general application of this system would reduce Plautian lines to a monotony

which wop-ld entirely spoil the charm of conversational liveliness we 'find in the
comio vn rs.

The word color must be pronounced as σοῖο in the following line:

color uerae, corpus solidum et suci plenum.
Ter. Eun. 11 3, 27.

and amor loses its final r in Ter. Andr. 1 5, 26
amor, misericordia. hfiius, nuptiarum sollicitatio-

,φατον follows the same analogy, e. g.

ne tibi aegritudinem, pater, parerem, parsi sedulo
Trin. 316.

. quid ego agam? pater iam hic me offendet miserum adueniens ebrium ὁ
Most. 378 (according to the MSS.)

pater uenit. sed quid pertimui autem, belua ·
,Ten Phorm.1v 2,11.

Prof. Key tells us to pronounce pere in these cases. The· possibility of
, such a pronunciation is questioned by Bitschl (Proll. Prin. CLV) whose
words are as follows‘ In quibus (i. e. monosyllabis) si etiam pater habi-
tum est, eius rei et rationem et documenta desidero.- et omnium minime
ex eo argumentandum vesse quod, ut e soror monosyllabum secur, ita
e pater similiter factum esse pere dicunt, uel hinc intelligitur quod,
etsi frere quoque et mere e frater et mater contracta. sunt, tamen haec
latina nec >contendit quisquam nec poterit contendere unquam mono-
syllaba fuisse? This is, indeed, the best argument which ean be alleged
against Prof. Key’s way of pronouneing and eontracting Latin words
according to the analogy of the corresponding French forms 3 but has
it been understood and appreciated by Mr Parry‘l This scholar accuses
Ritschl of ‘ lesing sight of the difference in quantity’ between frater
mater and pateo& But Bitschl’s argument is entirely based on this
very same difference. He means that, ‘if we once begin to remodel
the old pronunciation of the Latin after the French, we must be
prepared to find a contracted pronunciation of mater and frater just
as well as of pater, all these words being treated alike in Frenoh as
mere flere pere. But we never meet with mater or frater as mono·
syllableS, on account of their different quantity, and this fact proves
that, as we cannot draw a sound conclusion from mere and frere as
to mater and frater, we cannot consequently rely upon the compar-ison

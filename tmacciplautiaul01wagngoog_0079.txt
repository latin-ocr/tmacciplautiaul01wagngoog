him, simply because in such cases a slight error lon his side might occur

more easily than where he purposely states the reading of the MS.
Any statement without the express addition of the name of a MS„
applies to B. In some instances, Ϊ have found it necessary to complete

. my statements with regard to J : my friend E. R. Horton at London

had the kindness to inspect all such passages as I was not quite
certain of. ⁸

In the first 80 lines, Ι have occasionally mentioned some readings of
a MS. at Cambridge (see p.VI11) written in the same year as my MS. γ.
By the kindness of the Rev. J. E. Β. Mayor, I am in possession of a very
accurate collation of this MS. for the first 80 lines of the Aulularia, for
which Ι am very much obliged to the learned gentleman‚ the more bess
cause he kindly bestowed his attention on so very bad a MS. as δ (this .
mark Ι choose for it).' Compared with δ, the MS. γ bears a much higher
character. In δ, the verses are written as prose, only sometimes we
may guess at the original distribution of the verses in the MS. from
which it was copied, capital letters suddenly appearing in the prose in
places where a verse should commence.

In some passages, Ithink that I have now succeeded m finding out
the true reading by way of better and more methodical conjectures than
Ι could formerly offer. These δεύτεραι φροντίδες are all mentioned in the
following ⁶ Addenda.’ I especially want to draw the attention of my
readers to v. 134, this being a memorable instance how frequently the
⁸ discovery of the easiest emendations will escape even to repeated at-
tempta In this passage I have every reason to regret my πρῶται
φροντίδες.

we find the following letter-associations without any influence on the
prosodiacal value of the preceding vowels:

α. pt„

mercimonium. aequa dicis. set optume eccum ipse aduenit
Persa 544.

nunc adeo ibo illuc, set optume gnatum meum
Merc. 329.

This is the reading of the MSS. in both passages, which Ritschl

alters very free1y3 it is, however, justly defended by M. Graiu, plaut.

etad. p. 16. Geppert (see Oorssen, ausspr. 2, 119) adds a third instance
of the same quantity, M ost. 410:

nam cuiuis homini, uel &ptumo uel pessumo

but this line is considered spurious by Ritschl.

neque dum exarui ex amoenis rebus et uoluptariis
⁹ Glor. 642.

uoluptabilem mihi nuntium tuo aduentu adtulisti
⁶ Epid. 1 1, 19.

uoluptatem inesse tentam...Rud. 459.

’ Τ116 same quantity uoldpcatcm in the beginning of a line occurs Ter.
Hauc. tim. 1 2, 10 aud Afran. Ribb. Gom. p. 17 9. In the same way we
have uoluptas· Ter. Hauc. cim 11, 19. Andr. v 4, 41. uoluptati-s [acc.
plur.] Plaut. Stich. 657. The short pronunciation of uolaptae itself is
very frequent, 6. g. Truc. 11 4, 7 5. 11 6, 59. 65. 1v 4, 7. Most. 1 3, 92.
136. 111 all these cases mea' follows and the two words conclude the
line ¹.

¹ Perhaps we should also acknowledge a short vowel before pt in the following
line from the Pseudulus (597).

septurnas esse aedis a porta...

This is the reading of the MSS. kept by Fleckeisen. Bitschl gives trochees 'from
v. 595 to 603, but not without the most violent alterations and deviations from the

MSS. Fleckeisen gives anapaests and is thus enabled to be more conservative. In
this one instance Bitschl reads septumas esse ά porta υ ³⁸³2 We venture to ask
whether it would not be better toread neptam, the ἱ», · · - ι - being shortened m
consequence of the accent being thrown on ffitff. ·

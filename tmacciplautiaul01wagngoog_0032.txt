er is long in pater Aul. 772. Trin. 645 ⁹. It has the same quantity
in three passages in Virgil, Aen. v 521. XI 469. XII 13. The- fact is
well accounted for by Prof. Key, Lat. Gram. p. 437 . To Corssen’s
objections (aus-spr. 1, 362) 1 cannot attach the least importance. He
puts a stress on the fact that the e of the nom. disappears in the other
cases, and holds this to be a proof of its shortness: how, then, would
he account for the η of πατήρ, which, neverthelesS, makes πατρός in the
genitive?

fei. Originally the e in the gen. and dat. sing. of the fifth declension
was always long⁸. Thus we have fidei Aul. 575.

2. Ι will now proceed to enumerate those terminations in conju·
qation which sometimes preserve their original long quantity contrary
to the general usage of the Augustan period.

In Plautus' prosody all those endings may be long where an original
vowel is contracted with the root-vowel of the verb. Thus he has not

the third persons analogously long:

This is admitted on all sides3 see Key, Lat. Gram. p. 428, who quotes
Ritschl's Pron. Prin. CLXXXIII. Prof. Key justly adds: ‘ There are
not wanting similar examples in Virgil and Horace3 but editors and
teachers complacently get over the difficulty by attributing the unusual
length to the so-called principle of caesura, or to poetical licence.' I am
sorry to see the same error in Parry's Introduction to Terence p. IN,
where the subjunctive auyedt (Ter. Ad. prol. 25) is attributed to the
influence of ‘ictus’s but the ending at, just as well as ὂᾶι in the imperf„
was originally long, as will be seen from the second persons ᾶε ὂᾶε and

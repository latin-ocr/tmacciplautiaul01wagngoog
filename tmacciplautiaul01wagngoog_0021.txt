corrected copy of a very faulty archetype. Whether this presumption
be true ornet, we shall soon have to decide.

The last page of the MS. is filled with an extract on the critical
signs used by the ancient grammarians taken from Isidor (Orig. 1 20) ¹,
but without any indication of its source. It is written in the same
handwriting as the preceding Plautian comedies.

Before entering into a detailed discussion of the critical value of
this MS„ Ι have to say a few words as to its general orthography.
Generally speaking, it is much inferior to B in this respect: almost all
the old spellings we find in B, are modernised in J. Our commentary
will show that such forms as thesaurus adolescens auunculus surripio
surripui surreptum cum etc. are much more frequent in J than then-
saurus amaseam etc. as found in B. Nevertheless‚ not a few traces of
older and better spellings are left, e. g. aput opti9it optarat (302) coruos
etc. Ι may confidently state that I have tried to be as careful as
possible with regard to these minutiae, and I hope that nothing has
escaped my eyes, the MS. having been collated by myself twice over

and inspected again wherever a doubt arose. But there is one point in
which this MS. differs essentially from B: viz. its treatment of enclitics
and proditics. Ι presumo that this is a point very osten neglected by
manuscript-collatum, although it seems to have a just claim upon our
attention, as being an undoubted relic of antiquity which we ought to
notice, if not to preserve. Ritschl has a few lines about it, Pron. Tria.

apse = ab se, Trin. '7 9.
apstirpe = ab stirpe, ibid. 217.

both found in Β. Ι may add that it is not difficult to collect many other
instances of such spellings from Ritschl's critical comneni-ary, e. g.

apste = abs te, Persa 50 (B)

allaeuam = ad laeuam, Glor. 361 (Β)

appatrem = ad patrem, Merc. 962 (G)

summanus = sub manus, Pers. 450 (BCD ‘ quod obscwroere
⁴nolwi’ Ritsehl)

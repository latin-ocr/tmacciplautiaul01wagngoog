100. On Bona Fortuna see Preller, rb'm. myth. p. 559. It appears
‘from a passage of Diomedes, that the words Bona Fortuna te quaesiuit
were commonly used in the sense of mmo te quaesiuit. In a fragment
of Afranius recently pointed out by L. Miiller (rhein. mus. xx 374) we
have an instance of this expression ; it runs as follows: ‘Adule-ecem.
num quis me quaesiit? Samos. Bona Fortuna? There is, however, no

reason to suppose that Euclio alludes to this, as is the opinion of some
commentators ; it is, perhaps, more natural to understand the words

simply such as they are ‘ Let nobody enter my house, not even Good
Luck itselfi’

102. Those commentators who adopt the reading of B, suppose that
a temple of Bona Fortuna was close to Euclio’s house. This is, as
Kopke remarks, highly improbable ; there is a temple of Fides in the
vicinity, into which Euclio afterwards carries his treasure (v, 575), and
as there is also Megadorus’ house on the stage, we can hardly accommo-
date another temple. There occur, besides, no other allusions to such a
temple of Fortuna, which would doubtless be the case, had this decora·
tion been a necessary part of the scenery. I have therefore adopted
Gronovius’ emendation which though founded on some MSS. of inferior
velue, is recommended by the simple and appropriate sense it gives.
The adverb quaquam rests on the authority of Charisius 11 p. 192 P.

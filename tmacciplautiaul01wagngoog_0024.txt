uncertain valae, and the readings in which they differ from older au-
thorities are to be considered as mere conjectures of the scribes or of
some learned person whose emendations they adopted. Το represent
this class of Plautian Mss„ which Ι may comprehend under the name
of corrected copies, Ι have selected γ, simply because it is a dated MS.
and unites in itself the different corrections of more than one emen-
dator. It is interesting to compare with γ the readings of a MS. at
Cambridge, mentioned by Hildyard, l. l. p. xv, which bears the sub-
scription F'lor'. dic uiqecimo primo decembris ιι. οἷέοοκνθι the two MSS.
being written in the same year. (See ‘A.ddenda.’)

What Ι have said about Hildyard’s MSS„ applies to several other
MSS. occasionally mentioned in my notes, e. g. the six Palatini and
the Lanqiani collated by Parcus and Gruter, and the Guelferbytanae,
Helmstadicnsis and Monacensis of Bothe ¹—they all are later MSS.
‘without any authority, though some praiseworthy emendations may
be due to them. It is, therefore, of no use whatever to accumulate
all their various readings, which Ι might have done easily: but
moderation in this point seems to me wiser. than superfluous industry.
An editor should give all such readings as are actually of importance
for the text itself or its history, but at the same time he should
carefully avoid all unnecessary accumulation of insignificant variations
of late MSS„ or he runs the risk of tiring his reader's patience with
a work which can have given neither amusement nor instruction to
its author himself.

Ι may now proceed to examine more accurately the critical value
of J and ,its relation to Β. In doing sc, Ι must briefly acquaint my
readers with the stemma of the Plautian MSS. given by Ritschl,
Pron. Prin. xxxvn. Ritschl allows J the same value as Β, while

he presupposes an unknown and non-extant MS. ζ as the source of
almost all the other MSS. of the first eight comedieS. Now, Ι do

not presume to conjecture, whether Ritschl’s knowledge of J was
founded on more than Hildyard's partial collations: but however

this may be, Ι can by no means agree with his view of the subject,
though Ι may add that I found it very hard to dissent from so accu-

.· .1 Ι am inclined to think that Bothe sadly misrepresents the age of these MSS.

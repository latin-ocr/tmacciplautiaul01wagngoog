diebus, Campana solitus milla {cappamque profestis. Afranius 262
Ribb. aeque profesto ac sesto concelebrat focum. Festus p. 229 with a
doubtful etymology explains profesti dies dicti, quod sunt procul a reliqiom
numinis diuini—potavere in the sense ‘ to live sparingly,' comp. pameas.

380. ἢ uentri in the first place, as being mainly concerned in this
deliberation: cor, because his common sense would advise him to ven-
ture on a small expense: animus (381) the domineer'mg principle, ‘will
and inclination.’ The whole sounds like the description of a transaction
in the senate or some other powerful body.

383. See note on v. 24.

385. fortunatas facere .· the complete formula would be quod bonum
faustumfhlixsortunatumque sit: see Cicero de diu. 1 45, 102, and Tria.
41 where the Lar is asked to see ut haec habitatio Bona fausta filiaesor-
tunataque euenat.

387. The particle nvmmam occurs several times in Plautus and
Terence3 of numne Bitschl (Prole. Lxxv) gives only one instance Pom.
v 2, 119: see also Sueten. rell. ed. Reifferscheid p. 524. Euclio hopes
that his sear is groundless. Zumpt ξ 351 note.

388. The ablativo uicinia stands in 13³7, while other corrected
MSS. give uiciniam. Ι have kept the ablative which admits of the
explanation ‘ from the neighbourhood,’ according to the old and original
sense of this case: see Key, L. G. § 1021. Zumpt § 481. Similarly
Plautus has foris concrepuit proxuma uicinia Most. 1062: at least such
is the reading of ABD (0) 3 but as proxume uiciniae is found Olor. 273
and Bacch. 205, Bitschl gives the same reading in the passage from the
Mostellaria, although there will perhaps be some who would question
his right of doing so.-1f we take uicinia in the sense of uicini (comp.
Hor. serm. 11 5, 106), Lambinus' and Douza's conjecture pote ex uicinia
would be preferable: but Ι think that there is no absolute necessity for
altering the reading of the MSS.--F0r the form aula = olla, from which
the whole play takes its name, see Oorssen, amspr. 1, 165.

390. ᾱίεΡθήίε see note on v. 240.

391. After ddiuua it would be better to place a comma. mihi in
this line should either be pronounced as the monosyllabic mi or the first
syllable in atque be shortened (see p. xxxvm). Ι have here and v. 427
left the disyllabic form as it would be difficult to decide whether a con-
tracted pronunciation would be absolutely necessary or whether an
original iamb is shortened to a pyrrhich.

392. Euclio implores Apollo in his quality as ἀλεξίκακος. But
when did Apollo help Euclio in former times‘i Nothing with regard to
this is said in the play itself, and this must make us suspicions of the
whole line: and our suspicions will be strengthened when we consider

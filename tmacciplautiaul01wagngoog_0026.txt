the same recension as B, though there were several discrepancies be-
tween them3 but as to the present state of J itself, it is in every
respect much inferior to B and must be used with much cantion,
since we can never know what is really due to its archetype or
what to its emendator.

The critical commentary of this edition is intended to give all
matter necessary ιο authenticate the readings in the text Ι (10 not,
however, aspire ιο the minute exactneae of Ritschl's Plautus with
regard ιο the many emendations and conjectures of modern scholars.
Ι think it superfluous (at least for the purpose of the present edition)
ιο give the exact references where the reader has ιο look for the
emendations either adopted in the text or mentioned in the notes:
it will, Ι suppose, suffice in every case to indicate their authors ¹.
Sometimes, however, even a general note ‘ aete. edd: will be found 3 it
means that the errors of the MSS. are already corrected in the editions
before Camerarius. The readings of the editio princeps² are purposely
omitted, since they are of no critical value at all.

As regards the leading principles of my criticism, Ι may say that
I have been more conservative with regard to the MSS. than Ritschl
generally is. ‘Non omnes ommia decent’ is an old saying and a
true one 3 and a genius like Bitschl may well venture to take more
liberties with the text of the MSS. than other mortals can safely
indulge in⁸. 1 may, however, console myself with the fact that, by
returning to the readings of the same MSS. ‚ to which he had formerly
paid so little respect, Ritschl himself has made his best discoveries in
Latin grammar and in the history of the language in its earliest state.
A still greater conservatism reigns in Corssen's book on Latin pronun-
ciation‚ and in Studemund's dissertation de canticis Plautinis ⁴. Still,

¹ Hare's emendations are taken from his manuscript notes on Plautus, which
are now'in the possession of the British Museum, under no. 5171.

⁸ Non eet is scriptor Plautus, quo cum ea quae tantis hodie laudibus mactari solet.

⁴ 1 avail myself of this opportunity to mention for the benefit of such readers
as are not yet acquainted with it, a paper by Prof. Key ‘ ffiseellaneous Remarks
suggested by Bitschl's Plautus,’ in the Transactiom of the Philoloqical Society
1861 p. 172-197. It is, as all the papers of Prot. Key, fun of excellent remarks,

though there are some points on which 1 should venture to dissent from his views.

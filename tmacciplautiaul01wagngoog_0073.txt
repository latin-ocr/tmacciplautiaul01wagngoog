This instance may serve as another palpable illustration-of the truth
ef the observation made p. xlvi. with regard to the elasticity of Plautian
prosody.

We may finally draw the reader's attention to the general fact that
compounds in which two vowels come together, are always pronounced
per eynizeein in Plautus and Terence, e.g. dein deinde¹ proin proinde
dehinc deorsum seorsum prae‘Bptwe diosculari.

0. HIATUS.

In order to complete our sketch of the pronunciation of Latin as seen
in the comic writers, we must also touch upon a subject which is, how-
ever, one of the most difficult points in Plautian criticism, viz. the
hiatus. After the vast, but uncritical labours of Linge, Ritschl first
gave some distinct and positive rules with regard to the admission of
hiatus on the metres of the eomic writerS, in the xlvth chapter of his

Proleqomena, though his views as given there were afterwards in many
respects corrected and enlarged by himself.

There is, at least, one point on which no doubt can possibly exist,
and this discriminates Ritschl’s views from those of former scholars.
We shall quote his own words²z ‘impeditior eet de hiatu quaestio. non
dicam autem contra eos qui quouis et loeo et modo admissum hiatum
concoquunt concoctisque bonos uersus eoncaeant: quis enim lauare
latere-m animum inducat? uerum qui in ipsa caesura senariorum ad-

sectati poetae, sed licentiam potius quam eibi indulserint? The trubh Of
this assertion appears from Cicero’s words (Or. ξ 150) ‘nemo tam '‘2⁶⁸-

Fleckeisen. See L. Miiller, de re metr. p. 265.

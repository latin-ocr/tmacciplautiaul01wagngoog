reigns in the Plautian plays could safely venture to do this, especially
since the poet was sure that his audience did not consist of a selected
company of refined taste„ but of a boisterouS, noisy and unorderly multi-
tude. See the prologus to the Poenulus,

710. uestitu et creta = uestitu cretata (ἓν διὰ δυοῖν). ‘ Scribitur in
homines tenuiores; quibus cum copia mutandae togae non esset, tamen
ut nitidi et melioris fortunae apparerent, sub dies ludorum togulam
suam incretabant.' Lipsius. Koepke justly adds that there is an allusion
to the candidati in this passage, who would fain recommend themselves
to the citizens on account of their pretended virtue and honesty, though
they must be conscious of their unworthin ess. This is the more certain on
account of the words atque sedent.1n Plautus' time, the spectators used
to stand, and only ‘'gentlemen of some rank had their chairs brought
into the theatre. see Ritschl, Pwr. 218 and xx. Mommsen, reim. qesch.

713. For ornabas see Introd. p. 101. omar-e has here a more general

similar passage in Ter. Ad. 11 1, 22 ornatus esses sm tuis afflatibus ‘ thou
shouldst b'e dealt with according to thy meritsss—The error menatae
which we find in ιῙγ pei-vades a great many of the later MSS. and in
some of them there are curious explanatione of this uox nihili. In the
Harleian MS. 2634 ag. we find the following note: ’ὅρμος Graece portus,
unde omasus ancoris alligatus dictum: sensus ergo, in pessimum deuec-‚
tus portum,' and in γ itself there is a marginal note ‘ ὄρμάω impetum
facio?

423. hauscio is in Pla-utus one word in the same way as the com-
mon nescio .· see Key, L. G. § 1401, 1.

424. ‘nam should be joined with quid .· see note 011 v. 42.

426. 111 uenimus and malma the final consonants should be dropt.—-
malwm is here an interjection apparently belonging ιο conversaticnal
language and which will be frequently met with in the comic writers.
Even Cicero uses it occasionally, 6. g. off: 11 15, 13 quae te malum ratio
im. istwm spem &duxit ‘what the deuce could lead you to such a hope? ⁹
Verr. 1 20, 54 quae malam est ista taxata audacia atque amentia? It
always expresses a strong degree of indignation and anger.

427. For the reading of this line see p. Lxx. The disjunctive
question umm—ne—cm is explained by Key, L. G. § 1425 (with note),
Zumpt § 554, Madvig § 452, l: examples will be found Prin. 306.

the comic writers Ι cannot find a single instance of utrumne-an, and
am therefore now disposed to adopt Studemund's correction utrum cmo-
dumne an (‘ de cant? p. 32). Madvig remarks in general that utrumme
-απ is confined ιο poetical usage 3 he should have said more appropri-
ately that it belongs to the silver age. The example quoted from
Cicero pro Quinctio 30, 92 is altered in modern editions, although I
cannot at present ascertain 011 what authority. Other examples are
given from Pliny, Tacitus (dial. de or. 35 and 37), Quintilian, Suetonius
and Columella. The first instance where it occurs, seems to be Cat. 97, ²

432—437 1 have secluded from the text as a dittography of v. 428—
431. The real origin of this piece may be seen by comparing v. 432
with 428 (where we should also read coquere hic, see p. Lxx), v. 434 with
421. 416. 543, and v. 437 with 451. There is, moreover, 110 reason why
Congrio should again begin to quarrel, since Euclio’s words scic, ne doce,
noui sufficiently indicate his intention not ιο listen ιο any further com-
plaints of the cook. It may further be urged that the form emylzw
which we should have to assume for v. 434, is indeed unexampled in
Plautus or any other poct3 Bitschl, de titulo Aletrinatium p. 11 s.

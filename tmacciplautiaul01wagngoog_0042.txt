xxviii mraonuonon.

Luc. Miiller’s words (de re m. p. 340) ‘etiam hanc licentiam intendere
christiani, apud quos inueniuntur attenuata finali time dimoue praecaue
arce extorq‘eoe percense!

The imperatives of the fourth conj ugation show the same shortening
propensity. Thus we have ueni (Persa 30) abi (Most. 66) redi (Aul. 81.
441. Truc. 1 2, 106= 210 Geppert).

It is not difficule to give more instances of all the cases mentioned,
but I think those given will suffice to convince even the most in-
credulous of the existence of shortened final vowels in the prosody of
the comic poets. I have not quoted many instances from Terence, but I
should recommend to the readers of the present pages to peruse Parry's
Introduction to Terence, which is, indeed, a very careful collection of
all the prosodiacal abnormities of Terentian versification, though Mr
Parry explains them in a very different manner. 1 may state that
Mr Parry generally adopts Prof. Key's views, he being the writer
in the ‘Journal of Education’ 11 344 dvc„ as will be easily ascertained
by looking into Prof. Key’s prefatory letter to the ‘ Alphabet'
(1844 p. 6).

We shall now briefly enumerate other verbal endings which appear
short in Plautian prosody contrary to the usage of the Augustan
period,

An originally long iwas shortened in the passive infinitive¹, ‘e. g. dan-z
(Plaut. Eud. 960. Ter. Ad. 311. Phoron. 261), pati (Aul. 719), loqui
(Bacch. 1104): see Ritschl Pron. CLXVIII. Oorssen, ausspr. 1, 341, and
in the perf. act. dedi bibi steti (Comen, ibid.) adtuli (Aul. 430) occidi
(ib. 7 05 ').-o was shortened in the first persons οὔ aq& αοίὄ scio sino
neq& dabo ετὸ cedd (Oorssen 1, 345): in the same way we have iussero
Aul. 439, which may be compared to diser& Hor. Scrm. 1 4, 104.
odero Ou. am. 111 11, 35. Other instances of a shortened final o
from later poets are given by L. Miiller, dc re metr. p. 336. The
imperative dato stands as a pyrrhich Bacch. 84, and it seems to have

² Compare uici Anth. Lat. Meyeri 1157, 7. sect ibid.‚9. It is curicus that the
editor of the Anthology denies the short quantity of the final i in the perf. in another

instance, 1165, 5 finibus Ῐεαῑίάι nwnumentum uidi Vobernae. A pentameter ends
uixi dies 1203, 13.

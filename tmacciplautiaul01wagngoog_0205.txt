the spoken language used milvos and larva, and that the vocalisation of
the v was due to the usage of the poets.

locupletes qui certa sponsione pecuniae illum, unde petebatur, uadi-
monium obiturum seu in ius uenturum recipiant et promittant. da-
bantur autem uades, ne in carcere attinerentur usque in diem iudicii’
Gronovius Lect. Plaut. p. 51. See Plaut. Cure. v 2, 23—27 and the
commentatore on Hor. serm. 1 9, 74-78, (Walter, rom. rechtsgesoh.
§ 728 ss.)

318. On sescenta see Donatus' note on Ter. Phorm. 1v 3, 63 ‘ per-
spicere hinc licet consuetudinem utriusque sermonis. nam Apollodorus
μυρίας dixit pro multis, et ut apud Graecos μυρία, ita apud nos sescenta
dicere pro multis usitatum est.’ Hildyard observes that sescenta tanta
Pseud. 11 2, 37 might be translated five hundred times.

320. Cooks used to have a bad repnte at Rome, as the whole soene
in the Pseudulus 111 2 between Ballio and the cook shows. celeres
manus are an attribute of thieves, e. g. in a line quoted from Plautus’
Cornicularia (p. 1470 Taubm. ) mihi, Lauerna, in ficrtis celera-esis manus.

Congrio himself prays to Laverna‚ v. 442.
321. Perhaps it would be better to give the words cocum eqo me

dico to Congrio, who would not be silent when provoked by Strobilus’
taunting expressions. Antrax, on the contrary, answers when asked
quid tu aie? In such matters as these we need not too anxiously
depend upon the Meis—With sic sum ut uides comp. Theocr. Id. ΠΗ
59 τοιόσδ’ οἷον ὁρᾷς.

322. The explanation of the expression cocus nundinalis is not
quite settled, and we learn from Festus (see crit. notes) that even in

ancient times the grammarians were not quite agreed with regard to
this passage. nundinali-s would come ‚from nundinae (= mumdinae,

Corssen, ausspr. 1, 137) and would of course mean a very bad and
worthless cook hired only on market-days. But I should far prefer the
other reading which is clearly indicated by Festus, but generally con-
founded with nundinalis, and this is nundialis. novendialia are ex-
plained in an old glossary ἔνατα ἐπὶ νεκροῦ ἀγόμενα (see e. g. Petron. 65):
cocus nundiabis would thus signify a cook hired for the so-called ‘sili-
cernium‚' and for festivals of that nature not the best oooks seem to
have been generally hired. The leno Ballio says of a very bad cook
in this sense quin ob casm rem Orous recipere ad se hunc noluit, Vt esset
hic qui mwrtuie cenam coquat: Pseud. 795 s. I should not therefore
hesitate to write nundialist.

324. Congrio is not slow to understand Antrax's meaning, and
pays him back with interest. Antrax gives him the title of a thies (Fva),

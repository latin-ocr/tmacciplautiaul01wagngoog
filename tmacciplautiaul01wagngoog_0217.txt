EXEGETIGAL COMMENTARY. 1 2 7

τοῦ λαβεῖν 16 of course only 6 mauvaie jeu d'esprit. Congrio proves
however by. praying to Laverna, that Strobilus (v. 320) was not mis-
taken in his character.

443. The metrical scansion of this line is not quite certain, since I
cannot make up my mind to admit Studemund's verses (see crit. note
011 v. 415). For the explanation of the passage see Varro as quoted in
the crit. notes. Gomp. (ἷζον. 584 noan nunc eatis pipulo inpio merui
mali. To a similar scene as the present may have belonged the lines
quoted from Matius’ Mimiwmbi by Gellius xx 9: dein coquenti iodea
cuncta deiectat, Nequdmue scitamenta pipulo poscit. Besides these pas-
sages, the word is quoted from no other author except Appuleius·

445. For nummus see note on v. 108.

448. intro occurs here and Stich. 534: Ritschl corrects both passages
Proll. cxxlx: but there is no doubt that this word belongs to the same
class as inde ande nempe (Introd. p. XLV) in which the n or m of the first
syllable had only a very weak sound. Fleckeisen admits intro in the
Stichus. -I have adopted 13116 nominative plur. omnis as found in J,
as we have many examples of 13116 13611111116131011 is in this case: 666 Lach-
mann on Lucr. p. 56. Munr0, Introd. p. 27 and on 1 308.

449 qreoe uenalium ‘ a gang of slaves :’ comp. Cist. 1v 2, 67 mi-
rum quin yrex uenalium in cistella insuerit una. The same expression
occurs in the Pseudo-Ciceronian speech cum senatui qratias eqit 6, 14
Gaffadocem modo abreptwm de qreqe uenalium dicere-9. ι

451. temperi occurs nineteen times in Plautus, but never in Te-
rence. In all the Plautian passages, temperi is the reading of the best
authorities, not tempori, except Capt. 183 where tempori Β, tempe (more
is not legible) J. The comparative temperius is used by Cicero, ovid,
Columella, Appuleius and Palladius: tempm‘us is only found in very
bad MSS. See Ritschl in Reifferscheid’s Suetonius p. 507 ssa—With
the whole sentence comp. Cas. 11 7, 60 temperi, postquam oppuqnatumst
oa—fisewm as subst. 16 reported from only one other passage, in Celsus.
Weise compares fissa uulnera Val. Flacc. 1 479. For the genitive see
Key, L. G. § 941. Ι11 Cas, 1 1, 35 690 te inplebo flaqrie we have the
same way of speaking with a different construction.

45 3. For the shortened quantity of abs see Introd. p. Lu.

454. The long final o in eqo is accounted for Introd. p. xxv and
an3 Ι (10 11013 deem it necessary to write coctum 090 [huc] after the
example of v. 452.

455. leye aqito ‘ go 130 law, if you want any further expostulation,’
i. 6. you won’t get anything out of me by talking 011 ever so much. Τ116
661116 phrase occurs with this sense Ter. Phorm. v 7, 91.

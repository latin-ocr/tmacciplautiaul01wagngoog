1 10 EXEGBTIOAL COMMENTARY.

· phrase will be found showing that ludo facere aliquem, ludum facere

aliquem, ludos dame‘alkauem are not Plautian expressions,

252. In mpiam copiast observe the alliteration together with asso-
nance. Thornton remarks ‘There is a poor coneeit here. Megadorus
had said ludos facias, which may signify you make oport os me, or you
yive a publio show, play or spectacle ,· in which latter sense Euclio takes
it and replies I could not, {f I would, by reason of his poverty.‘ This
play on the expression used by Megadorus is really so very poor that we
cannot believe it to be intended by Plautus himself, but it seems rather
due to the refinement of the commentatore. Euclio very strongly ex·
presses the idea ‘how could so poor a man as 1 make sport of so rich a
gentleman as youl'

254. It is of course equally correct whether we accent offan illa or
cum illa, but the first pronunciation seems to harmonize more with the
habit of Plautus: see Introd. p. Lx111.—Oomp. Tm’n. 571 nunc tuwm
sororem fibio posco mee, Quae res bene vortat—La di bene vortant .-

257. The verb perpleaeari occurs only here in Plautus 3 Terence ex-
presses the same by perplexe loqui Eun. v 1, 1. Oomp. uerbwm per-
pleaeabile As, 1v 1, 47.

258. pactum non pactzimst] ‘ hac (accentus) uariatione boni poetae
saepissime utuntur in repetitione, ne idem uocabulum eodem accentu
recurrat.. ‚Italis quoque haec perquam familiaria sunt nec nostris poe'tis

ἱπροὺναόἰε, inperator, quod eqo potero, quod uoles ‘thou shalt have any-
thing, as far as it is in my power' (quot or quod the MSS„ quoad
Bitschl’s edition). In a tetrameter bacchiacus M en. 769 we have the
same uerzimsc modus tamen, quod pati ‘tiatorem oportet ‘still there is a
measure whereto a wife must be patient' (quod (Π), quo adpati B, quoad
Bitschl after Lambinus). In Terence we find two instances of this
meaning of quod: Eun. 11 1, 7 e. munus noeto-um ornato uerbis quod
poteris, et illum aemulum, Quod poteris ab ea pellito, and Haut. tim. 111
1, 7 quod potero, adiutabo senem. In the construction quod eius it is
generally known in this sense: see Key, L. G. § 922.

259. The genuine Plautian form would be controuersia, in accord-
ance with uorto 255. -

260. The reader is requested to rectify a typical error in the text,
where we ought to have numquaest. —For the construction ‚compare

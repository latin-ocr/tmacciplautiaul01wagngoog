104 ExncmloAL COMMENTARY.

canat: see Trin. 573.—‘ Abituri, ne id dure facerent, ‘numquid uis dice-
bant iis quibuscum constitissenh' Donatus on Ter. Eun. 11 3, 49.

Comp. Hor. serm. 1 9, 6.
174. For the hiatus conueniet-m Ι Eziclionem see Introd. p. Lx,

175. Τ118 reading of this line is not quite certain. Ι regret that
Klette's excellent conjecture (in his Exere. Terent. p. 21) escaped my
notice, when the text was in the press. He writes: sed eccum uideo,

nescio unde sese homo recipit domum. ‘but there Ι 888 him: he is just
returning home from some place or another (nescio πωπω) ,

176. For the explanation of praesaqire see Cicero as quoted in the
critical commentary. The passage in question has however been pro·
nounced spurious by Hottinger‚ and the last editor, Baiter, secludes it
from the text. See moreover note on v. 214. Terence says mi animus
praesaqit mali Haut. tim. 11 2, 7 .-For the formation of praesaqzbam
see note on v. 49. Key, L. G. ξ 461.

179. properare propero is a comical exaggeration frequently met
with in Plautus: see v. 242. Comp. Cure. 637 propere propera—animus
domist.- comp. Persa 709 animus iamin navist mihi. Merc. 589 εἰ (1οηιὺ
sum, foris eet animus .· sin foris sum, animus domist. Similar expres-
sions are found in Ter. Eun. 1v 7, 46 and Cic. ad Act. 111 12. Hence
we have to explain Cas. 111 3, 9 s. ·

182. non temerarium& ‘it’s not for nothing’ (Phora), comp. v. 616.
· 183. eo has here a monosyllabic pronunciation: see Introd. p. Lvn.
—blandius ‘very kindly' i.e. more kindly than he usually does. In this

· way the comparative is sometimes equal to a strengthened positive, comp. ,

Amph. prol. 56 set eqo stultior, i. e. ‘I'm very stupid.’ The same expres·
sion occurs M erc. 919.

184. a pecunia ‘as to my pecuniary circumstances,' comp. ab inqenio
inproba-st Truc. lv 3, 59, and Key, L. G. ξ 1303 8.-Τ118 ἰ in pecunia
undergoes here the process of synizesis.

185. For Ῐιαόἒᾴε) 888 Introd. p. xxxvm.

186. Euclio misunderstands the philosophie sentence with which
Megadorus tries to comfort him, viz. that· contentedness is the best
foundation of happiness, and readily suspects that Megadorus’ expression
sac habes alludes to his treasure.—-perspicue palamst] The two syno-
nyms express together only one idea ‘it is quite clear? Here, 88 in
properare propero (V. 179), alliteration helps to strengthen the ex-
pression.

187. For quoi eqo see Introd. p. Lxm. ,

, 189. uiryo qrandis ‘a full-grown girl.² I will here mention an
ingenious etymology given by Prof. Key, Tmnsaet. of the Phil. Soc.
1865 p. 7 3: ‘yramdis in the best writers is especially used of growth5.

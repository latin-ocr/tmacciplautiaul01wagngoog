of pere and pater. And indeed in Plautus or other poete, we never
find mate and frate = mater and frater, though in 'a Faliscan inscription
we actually read MATEHEOUPA, i.e. mater hic cubaffi. But this
is of course a low dialectic corruption ².

In the same way, we have to explain the loss of a final t and d.
An old form hau (instead of* haud) owes its existence to this process
(see note on v. 17o): it was used until the time of Tacitus, if we
may trust the authority of the Medicean MS. In the Aulularia we
have apa (= aput or'apud) in several instances (v. 83. 340. 736.), in
the same we should pronounce

caput: capu 422. 423.
erat = era 421.
ut = u 320. .
decet = dece 136. (See M. Graiu, plaut. stud. p. 10).

The preposition ad is thus often degraded to a simple d, e. g.

sed ad ,postremum Poen. 1v 2, 22.
qm's ad fores est Amph. ιν 2, 1.

et ad portitores Phorm. 1 2, 100.

ut ad pauca redeam Phorm, 1v 3, 43.

But it would-be superfluous to accumulate more instances of this fact:
we shall only add that even ‘nt was entirely dispensed with in the rapid
pronunciation of the time of Plautus. Bentley has quoted in his Sche-
diasma (p. xv ed. Lips.) the following instances:

solem &aaa = solet esse.

student scicere = stud& scicere.
habent despit-atu = Ιιαόἔ ιίἑερίσαία.

To these we might · easily add other instances from Plautus, but to
prove the existence of such forms as we assume here in the metres of

· ¹ See Ritschl, corp. imcr. lat. 1 89.

² The real explanation of such forms as pere mere frere is obvious. We have, of
course, to go back to patre matre fratre‚· the t gradually disappeared‚ as it was
already assimilated in parricida, and after the language had lost all differences of
quantity, i.e. when the aceent decided the length or shortness of a vowel, the three
words, though originally different, were thrown together under one head and dealt

with after the same laws. We need not add how dangerous‚ nay how fallacious, it
would be to draw inferences from the French with regard to the pronunciation of

Latin. I do not hesitate to accede to Bitschl’s assertion ‘ omnino tam esse lubricum
hoo genus comparationis arbitror, nihil ut inde proficias! (Pr-cll„ l. L).

1 1 4 EXEGETIOAI. COMMENTARY.

is quite groundless. Liqelbwm, as Nonius readS, would be a diminutive
from liquam, and would, of course, give the same sense, but occurs no-
where else. Most of the eommentators take, however, dc suo tiqello in
the sense of ‘from his house,’ or as Hildyard says, ‘ through the rafters
of his house.’ As there is no other passage in any author, where tiqil-
lum would have the sense domicilium breue, I prefer the explanation
given by Pareus according to which we need not invent a new sense for
this passage. Euclio thinks that he is audone, when the smallest piece
of wood is burned in his house, and he therefore keeps no wood in the
house: see v. 355.

300. ‘ Some commentators suppose, by follem is meant a pua-ce, but
the plain and obvious sense of this word appears to be a kind of hay,
which Strobilus supposes Euclio to fasten to his mouth and throat to
catch his breath in, while he is asleep. The thought is extravagant,
but humorous. ' Thermon.

302. quum· is masculine in another Plautian passage, Glor. 835.
Novius too has usque ad imum quum-em v, 118 Ribb.

304. ‘ Innuit neutri ab altero esse credendum? Acidaliae.

305. The words at scin etia-m quomodo simply form a connexion
between the preceding jokes and those that follow. This same phrase
is generally used to express threats‚ and thus we have it v. 47: see
Weise’s note on Poen. 1 2, 165 3 but it occurs in the same way as here
in another passage, Poc‘n. 1 3, 29.—F0r the hiatus in this line see Introd.
p. LX.

306. See Introd. p. L—plorat ‘he eries his eyes out3' for the
infin. comp. Hor. od. 111 10, 4. Aristophanes has a similar joke
about a mean Athenian, Patrocles, Plut. 84 ἑκ Πατροκλέους ἔρχομαι,
ὃς οὐκ ἐλούσατ’ ἐξ ὅτουπερ ἐγένετο. This however means that Patro-
cles never took a bath since his birth, because he was too mean to pay
for it.

307. pote alone stands not only for potes (e. g. Trin. 352) andpotest,
but even for posse. See Ritsch1‚ Prole. CXL—For the so-called ‘great'
talent, see Smith’s Dictionary of Antiquities S. v. Talentum

308. For ab istoc see Introd. p. nvn—qui =ut inde, see Key, L.
G. § 312, 2.

309. See note on v. 96.

311. praeseqmina, ἀπονυχίσματα, ‘ parings?

312. parce parcus ‘a most stingy wretch ’ (storacen). For the
expression comp. Pseud. l l misere miser or Cae. 111 1, 8 scite scitus
and similar passages: see also note on 42.

314. miluos and larua are always trisyllabic in Plautian prosody.
It is therefore very improbable that, as Corssen says (amspr. 1, 135),

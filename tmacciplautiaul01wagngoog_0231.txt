nation: comp. however Trv'm. 101 1 where the slave Stasimus exhorts
. himself caue eis tibi ne bubuli in te cottabi crebri crepent, and Stich.
63 Antipho threatens his servants uos monimentis conmonefaciaan bubu-
lie. Slaves are therefore called bucaedae Most. 884: ibid. 882 we read

(eruc) male caetiyabit eos exuuiis bethulia—In the MS. B we find here

the note ut carne, which is, as I suppose, to be referred to v. 372 where
beef (caro bubula) is mentioned.

594. The hiatus ‘anquam in is legitimate in the caesura: see In·
trod. p. Lx.

595. nam indicates here no internal, but only an externa] con-
nexion of the following sentence with the preceding speech: or to speak
more clearly, we should supply such a sentence as ⁴ I make all these
observations not in vain, for my master etc.' ‘nam is in this way very
frequently used by the comic writers. See also on 28.—huiue‚ i. e.
who lives here, in this house. In the same way we have kuic M eqadoro
in the next line. He points towards the house.
⁴ 598. cine omni=eine ulla, see note on 213.—suspitio is the spelling
generally found in the best MSS. of Plautus, Terence, Caesar, CicerO,
Curtius and Tacitus: the word is a contraction from* suspicitio, an ety-
mology which at the same time accounts for the different quantity of
euspicio (noun) and suspicio (verb) suspicor. Another theory is pro·
pounded by Gorssen, beitr. p. 15 s.

599. arbitrarier is here = inspicere, comp. arbiter = spectator Capt.

of the word into the English language, Par. Loct 1 7 85 ‘ while over-head

600. indicassis: see note on 226.

602. praedam aqere is originally a military phrase like the Greek
λεηλατεῖν.

603. The genitive auri aster onustam should be explained after the
analogy of inplere (see note on 544) and aula ‚auri plena 813. The ab·
lative onustam auro soe—prohibeam :prohibeueeie :prohibuerim for
the formation comp. note “on 226 and the perfects deleui neuifleui. pro-
hibessit Pseud. 14. Lucretius has aueseis 1v 823.

605. accersere is so frequently found in the best MSS. (for Plautus
see the examples collected by Gruter on Cae. 111 4, 10 3 for Caesar Din-
ter’s note on b. 9. 1 31, 4) that it would be very arbitrary simply to
condemn this form, because we cannot explain it grammatically. There
certainly can be no doubt that arcessere is the genuine form: ar being
another form of the preposition ad (Corssen, auespr. 1, 89) and cesso the
intensive of cio. The other form accersere was perhaps peculiar to the
semo plebeius, in which case its frequent occurrence in Plautus should

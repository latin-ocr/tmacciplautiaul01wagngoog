-the 'genuine pronunciation of qu = c (Ῐο); see Corssen, amspr. 1, 35. It
is by no means isolated. or confined to this passage alone: e. g. B gives
qvoquas Pseud. 854, Bon have quoqitur Men. 214 and quoquam 218,
and even the old Ambrosian palimpsest has quoquinatum Pseud. 853.
Merkel too mentions perquoquit as found in the oldest MSS. of Ovid:
see his preface to the Teubner edition vol. 1 p. x111. If keeping such
forms stands in any need. of defence, let me refer to Mr. Munro's remarks

· Lucr. vol. 2 p. 28.

345. For puteus comp. v. 363. Ι find no other passages where
this kind of punishment for slaves is mentioned. In Greek the corre-

sponding word λάκκος means also a kind of cellar.

, ’ 346. The construction of the words 1s quippe qui ubi nihil est quod

submpias. For quippe qui with a following indicative see Key‚ L G.
ἕ 1194 note. qui in this connexion is an archaic asseverative particle
which in later language is only known in the compound atqui. For
instances see Rud. 384. Truc. 1 l, 49. Bacch. 368. Pseud. 1274.
Ter. Haut. tim. 538. ιΙῑι the same way we have ut qui in several in-
stances which have perversely been corrected by the editors: As. 505.
Prin. 637. Oapt. 553. Bacch. 283. See Fleckeisen, lorii. miscellen

·.p 32 s.

347. For subo-apiae see note on v. 39.

. 348. On the spelling hostium see v. 46. ——For qui as a direct inter-7
rogative see Madvig§ 88, 1.

351. The active infinitive mittere is defended 1n note on v. 242.

· 352. In the festivals called Cereris nuptiae no wine was used. see
Servius and Macrobius as quoted in the critical notes. The original
significance of these festivals is not quite evident 3 Preller (rom. myth.
p. 439) thinks that they commemorated the marriage of Pluto and Pro·
serpina, where Ceres should be considered as hostess.

353. ‘ uinwm ⁴temetum prisca linqua adpellatur' Gellius x 23: the
word is very rare in the language of prose-writers (only Plin. XIV 90
and Cic. de rep. 1v ap. Non. p. 5): see Riese, rhein. mus. xxt 119, who
in this point at least does not refute Biicheler, rhein. mus. xx 421.

354. ipsus, i. e. erus, Megadorus, ‘ the governor.’ This use of
ipsus is probably an imitation of the Greek αὐτ-ὃς, for thus disciples and

slaves called their masters: e. g. αὐτᾶς ἔφα ipse dimit, where αὐτός means
the all· revered master Pythagoras. Oomp Aul. 806 and Oa8.1v 2, 11

eqo eo quo ‘me ipsa misit, i. e. era.

355. See note on v. 299.
358. Ι have written cenaene, because Gruter expressly states that

Β gives this reading. As an analogous passage I could only quote a line
of ,Propertius (Π, 1,. 23) reynaue prima Remi aut mimos Carthaqinis

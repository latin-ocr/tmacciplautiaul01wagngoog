of it to be taken from Plautus’ original prologue. Το show my dis-
trust of the originality of the prologue, I have adopted the subscrip-
tion ¹found in the MS. B (see p. lxv).

v. 4. The construction of this line is somewhat negligent, though
used by Plautus himself in another passage: Persa 137 sicut istic
leno handum sex mensis M eqan‘bus huc est quom conmiqrauic. Hence
may have arisen the French way os expressing the same thought: il
y a beaucoup d’amzees que —. For the explanation of the present
tenses possideo and colo see Key, L. G. ξ 1455 6, note †, and §458.
—colo :incola as v. 693. H ere the notion of quaa-dim the house is
involved, in the same way as in Virgil’s expression nemorum cultrix
Latonia uirqo (Aen. 11 557) not only ‘ inhabitant,’ but protectress too
is meant.

5. patriqw auoque ‘for the advantage of—,’ see Key, L. G. § 97⁷.
— habet=habicat (cf. v. 21) frequently with Plautus. See Nonius as
quoted in the critical notes.

7. thensaurus 1s the true Plautian form which, in consequence of
the thin pronunciation of the letter u (see Key, ‘Alphabet’ etc. p. 141),
afterwards became thesaurus. In the same way we have M eqalensia—
Meqalesia, and all the numeral adverbs ending in ens lost their original
n in this manner. See Oorssen, ausspr. 1, 97 and the introduction
to this edition p. xiim—omnis is acc. plur. ‘ unknown to all :’ 666
Key, L. G. § 1319. It is very natural that clam governs the accusa-
tive, since it is very probably an adverb formed from the verb celare
and originally may have been celavn.

8. The syllables ans me ut form a dactyl, according to a metrioel
law which is explained Introd. p. lxiii.

9. Donatus observes that quoniam is here used in the mere sense
of a temporal conjunction, which the word is logically entitled to, being
but a compound of quom and iam. Plautus has it so not unfrequently,
e.g. Tria. 112 quoniam hinc iturust ipsus in Seleuciam. ibid. 149 quo-
uiam hinc profectu-sc ire pereqre Charmides. We may observo the same
change of the two notions of temporality and causality in the Ger-
man conj. weil, which has now almost entirely lost its temporal sense,
though this was the original one. N everthelesa Schiller uses it as an
equivalent to the English while, Wilhelm Tell, act 1 66. 2 ‘ weil ich
ferne bin, fiihre du mit klugem sinne das regiment des hause8.’—The
words ita auido ‘limenio fuit might stand in brackets, at least they do
not influence the construction of the sentence: ⁴ when he was about
to die, he did not—such was his avaricious disposition—reveal the

secret to his son.'
10. id here and v. 8 denotes the secret in general, and must not

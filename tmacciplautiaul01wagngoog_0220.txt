1 30 mmmmm. COMMENTARY.

, 472. condato ‘matcht’ see on v. 235.

47 3. laudant or rather a more general notion which we may infer
from this verb, e. g. dieunt, governs the construction of the words sapi-
enter factem».

478. For the short quantity of the first syllable in inuidia see
Introd. p. xlma—In this line, v. 479, 480 and 489 we may briefly draw.

⁸ the attention of the student to a peculiarity of the Latin: in compari-

sons the same verb is repeated, while in modern languagea e. g. English
and Freuch, the most general verb in the language ‘ to do’ ‘ faire’ is
substituted—For nwtwmt, not manmit, see Munro, Lucr. 2 p. 27 .

479. mala res frequently denotes ‘ punishment’ in the language of
the comio writers.

481 ss. This line seems the sole instance of the construction
bonum est in aliquem ‘it is good for.’ in would however admit of the
same explanation as in such phrases as pessume in te atque in illum con-
sulis Ter. H aut. tim. 111 1, 28. The next line contains another difficulty
first pointed out by Linge de hiatu p. 8: ‘ altercationem facimus cum
aliquo, non in aliquem ,·’ but in seems here to denote the object against
which the altercatio (i. e. political contention) is directed: see Zumpt
·§ 314. Yet this very meaning of altercatio is only assumed for this
passage. Notwithstanding all these difficulties, I believe the passage to
be quite correct, there being nothing in it which we might not explain
by way of analogy. Translate ‘ for most of our people it would be the
best, only a few fortune-hunters we should have to combat, but they
will catch rich heiresses in spite of laws and tutors.'

482. In this line we have another instance that J and later Mss.
preserve sometimes older and more genuine forms than we find in Β.
In all the later MSS. collated by Hildyard‚ we find the reading In
pauciori and the same seems to have been originally in J, where the
termination is is added over the first syllable of the next word auidos:
and this is no doubt intended for pmcioris, not for auidis, although
Hildyard states ‘auido-s, sed littera i superscripta? According to the
MSS. we have in Plautus many accusatives of the same kind, e. g.
leqionis Glor. 17. 224. latronis ib. 94. moris, ib. 40. hominis ib. 660.
piscatori-9 ib. 1183. melioris Trin. 707. inopis Rud. 257 ‘et si qui sunt
similes librariorum errores,' says Fleckeisen, ep. crit. xx. But Lach-
mann on Lucr. 1 744 rightly defends these forms by the accusative prae-
comis which is found in the lex de xx quaestoribus: and in the same
way we have the acc. plur. sonoris in Lucretius: see Munro 2 p. 27.

483. insatietas ‘ a greedy disposition: ἅπ. λεγ. Ammianus Marcel-
linus has insatiabilitas. .

484. ‘ Omnino tutoris mentionem hic miri aliquid habere, non

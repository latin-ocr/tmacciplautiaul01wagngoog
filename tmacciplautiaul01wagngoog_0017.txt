1. on me MSS. med in me preme edition osche Aulum-za.

ΤΗΕ text given in the present edition of the Aulularia is founded upon
an accurate collation of three MSS. , which have been thought sufficient
. to represent the textual history of this play. The MSS. made use os
are as follows:

(1) Β, the ‘uetus codex’ of Camerarius aud Pareus‚ now no, 1605 of
the Palatine library in the Vatican at Rome. This MS. ‚ written in
different hands in the eleventh century, consists of two separate parte,
which owe their connexion to the bookbinder, the first containing the
first eight, the other the last twelve comedies¹. As this MS. is the
oldest and best authority for the Aulularia, due care has been taken to
represent its readings with the utmost accuracy. Parcus’ second edition
has therefore been made the basis of our own recension‚ but his state-
ments about the readings of the MS. have been compared with Gruter-’s
additions in his revision of Taubmann’s edition ², and Pareus’ own Ana-
lecta Plautina which form the seventh volume of Gruter's Lampas
critica. As far as possible, the different corrections which have been
made in this MS„ are accurately recorded in our critical commentary‚

though the oldest hand (Ba) does not always give the correct reading
itself, but frequently furnishes us with the means of finding it out by

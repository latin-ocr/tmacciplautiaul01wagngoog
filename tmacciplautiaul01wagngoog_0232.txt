142 ’ EXEGETIOAL comitur-Y:

not surprise us. Bitschl gives accersere in many passages, e. g. Παι-
7 29. 763. 770. 776. 875. Most. 1044. low—me might mean that
Megadorus fetches Euclio to his house, since the nuptials are to be
celebrated there 3 it is, however, much more probable that me is not
due to the poet himself, but that the scribes repeated it from the
first syllable of meam: see crit. note. According to the reading of the
MSS„ the first syllable in accersat should be shortened (Introd. p. xuv);
in the other case we have the legitimate quantity quin ubi tieem-⁸62
meam: in both readings the first syllable in extemplo is shortened (In-
trod„ p. xnvl).

607. For fide=fidei see Key, L. G. ξ 88. Lucretius has facie,
Horace (serm. 1 3, 95) and Terence (Andr. 1 5, 61) have fide, Livy (v
13, 5) pernicie as datives: see Gorssen, ausspr. 2, 143.

609. If Schwarzmann’s collation be trustworthy‚ the MS. ι Β has
fides, as my edition gives it: I take this form here to be the old genitive

. which arose by contraction of eis, as we find the genitives dies in En-

nius (see also Key ξ 146), facies in Claudius Quadrigarius, rabies in Lu-
cretius (1v 1083 with Munro's note), pernicies in Cicero according to a
statement by Charisius. See Oorsseu, ausspr. 2, 140 s. Former editors
put a full stop after sano and consider Fides to be a vocative.

- 614. fidelia here ‘a wine-pot? comp. Pers. v 183 twmot albafidelc’a
uino. Plautus chooses this word on account of the paronomasy with

615. Το avoid the hiatus ahi id Ι have written oeficero, i. e. ‘aster
1 should have possessed myself of the treasure.' But perhaps we should
make no alteration and read bibcim ubi id without eliding the final
syllable in bibam. ‘ m finalis innumeris in locis non facit elisionem’ is
Weise’s assei-tion p. xxxn of the second volume of his Plautus, and
though Ritschl does not admit its truth, it seems to have some founda-
tion: see Oorssen, ausspr. 2, 197. But an accurate inquiry into this
subject is as yet a ‘ desideratum.'

616. The fears of the always suspicions Euclio have been awakened
by an unlucky omen. non temere est is explained by Donatus on Ter.
Haut.tim.1v 1, 7 as ‘non sine causa ς’ the same expression occurs in Terence
Eun. 11 2, 60. Phom. v 8, 8. We learn from 010. de diu. 1 39, 85 that
a dextra coruos, a sinistra cornix facit ratum, and this is confirmed by a
Plautian passage Asin. 11 1, 12 picus et cornix eet ab laeua, coruos porro
ab dextera: cmwuadent. A raven on the left was consequently an un-

lueky omen. This should not be confounded with the expression aui
sinistra Pseud. 762 and Epid. 11 2, 1 which means a lucky omen.

617. In semul (for the form see Bitschl Pron. 1110) the final l
should be dropt :¹ see Introd. p. xxxv, In the poesage from the Caprius·

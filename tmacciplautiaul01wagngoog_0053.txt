making its way and left permanent traces. Ι do not forget that such
strong violations of natural prosody as those given above, will probably
appear very barbarous to us and Ι know that many scholare will there-
fore treat them with obstinate incredulity, yet an impartial consideration
of the matter would show that there is at least no rational difference
between the shortening of ᾶι et ’ῖι and of ᾶε &s ῖε ὄε .· only the first
we accept, because it remain'ed short ever afterwards 3 the latter
appears strange to us, because the literary language of later times
returned to the original long quantity. To be brief, most people
,readily acknowledge the fait accompli, while they obstinately close their
eyes to the traces lest by a destructive and revolutionary power in the
popular speech of a certain period, because the same tendeneies were
afterwards purposely checked and could not therefore manifest them·-
selves in the literary dialect of a more cultivated period. But for such
as are determined, not to acknowledge any difference between litei-ary
and popular· dialects, these pages are not destined.

The shortened quantities of these syllables have indeed been doubted
by Ritschl, who in his edition of Plautus gets rid of them partly by
very free conjectures, partly by assuming the extrusion of the radical
vowels of the words in question. Ι propose to give a brief criticism of
the latter point, in translating a passage from M. Orain’s excellent
paper ‘ plautinische studien’ p. 12:

‘ G. Hermann (el. d. m. p. 65) considers domi boni mali malum. as
monosyllables in many passages, though he has never given his argu-
ments for the possibility of putting together such thoroughly different
cases, In accordance with G. Hermann’s views, Ritschl establishes a
monosyllabic pronunciation for enim aput quidem fores manus senex
simul, on which he remarks ‘quae quis tam prauo iudicio est ut correptis
potius ultimis syllabis qaam pronuntiando elisis pm‘mis diota esse con-
cendat κ’ (Pron. Prin. cn.. ε.) But where are the' proofs for the
possibility of extruding a radical vowel [in Iambic words] ¹, to preserve

² In adopting Mr. Crain’s criticism, Ι do not forget that amongst the numerous
etymologies of Latin words given by Prof. Key we find some ‘ compressions ’ of
iambic words into monosyllableS, e. g. trux is said to be a compression of an original
torax (Trans. of the Phil. Soc. 1856 p. 326). But Ι believe, Prof. Key himself

would not nse a very uncertain, though ingenious, derivation as a proof of an other-

wise hypothetica] explanation of Plautian prosody. We shan of course be ready to -

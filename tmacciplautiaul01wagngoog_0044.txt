guage, when first used for literary purposes, had already lost final con·
sonants: e. g. from the original genitives

mensa-is seruo-is re—is
we have after the loss of the final s

mensai‘ seruoi . rei

mensae serui re -

The formation of the abl. sing. gives us another instance. Originally
this case ended in d: men-sad seo-uod patred manud red: this d was
however dropt there as well as in the adverbs saciled etc„ which
were originally ablatives. These losses are previous to Plautus' time,
and in his language we find but obscure traces of them lest. We
read in a few instances a nom. plur. of the sec. decl. in ἅθ’, and the

forms med and ted are still used by Plautus, not by Terence. (See
note on v. 120). We may now proceed to enumerate those instances

where final consonante are dropt (i. e. do not count with regard to versi-
fication) in Plautus and Terence, contrary to the usage of the later or
classical language.

m We learn from Priscian 1 38 (Hertz) ‘ m obscwmm in excre-
mitate dictionum sonat} and Quintilian means the same 1x 4, 40 ‘ (m)
parwm eoepmssmimr. . ‚neque enim eximium sed obscuratur! On account
of its weak sound, a final m was often neglected in writing both in
nouns and verbs, as will be seen in numerous instances collected from
the oldest inscriptions by Corssen, ausspr. 1, 110. This disregard of a
final m seems to have been quite familiar to all the popular dialect-s
of Latin throughout its different periods, and hence we have to explain
hexameters ending cra-dentem lacernam, inmitem siqz'vraan (quoted from
Meyer’s Anthology 1223, 1. ὰ 1171, 4 by Ritschl‚ rhein. mus. ΧΠ 389) ⁹.
We shall therefore not be surprised to find many instances in which a
final m is entirely discarded in Plautian prosody‚ e. g. dowzwn is to be
pronounced as domu Aul. 148 dre. We shall here not give any special
instances of this fact, but it will be useful to draw the particular at-

² A pentameter ends with the words undecim post ibid. 1203, 12: the final m
must of course be dropt.

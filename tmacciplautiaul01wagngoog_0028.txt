xiv INTRODUOTION.

and the first editors did not hesitate to find Greek forms and imitatione
of Greek constructione in Plautian language 3 and as to verses, they
had either no idea at all of their laws and did not trouble themselves

about them, or at the best, their notions were very vague and more
like presentiment than the full possession of truth itself. Francois
Guyet, a French scholar of the l7th century, was the first to study the
versification of the comic poets, and though his results were intermixed

with a great many errors (as, indeed, it could not be otherwise), his
works seem to have given the first impulse to Bentley, if we may trust
to the simple fact that many emendations of Bentley’s in Terence are
already to be met with in Guyet’s ‘commentarii,’ nay, even some of his
caprices already occur there ¹. It is difficult not to say too much of
Bentley's merits with regard to Plautus and Terence 3 but we may ven..
ture to assert that his edition of Terence will continue a standard book
for philologers as long as classical philology shall be held in honour. Still,
it would be totally preposterous to think that Bentley's famous ‘Schedi-
asma’ gives the real key to the full understanding of Plautian prosody
and metres. Gottfried Hermann, who through his excellent teacher
Reiz had early become acquainted with Bentley's Terence, adopted and
refined his views both in his editions of the Trinummus and the Bac-

chides, and in his ‘Elementa dominae metricae,' where he has often

¹ 1 cannot better account for this fact than by referring to an observation made
by Prof. Fleckeisen on this point in a conversation we had some years ago. The
future editor of an elaborate edition of Terence was, of 0011180, well aware of the
fact in question, and he assui-ed me that in 1118 critical commentary 011 Terence the
note ‘Bentleius, item Guyetus' would be seen 'm many passages. He suspected
that Bentley might have read Guyet’s works and copied many of his emendations;
years afterwards, when he published his own Terence, he might well have forgotten
the real author of a great many of the conjectures he found scattered over the
margin 01 1118 copy, and as he approved 01 1110111, 110 took them for his own. But
how is it then, that Bentley sometimes mentions Guyet's name, but only to accuse
him 01 vanity, levity and rashness? And how is it that Bentley 18 otherwise very
careful to find out the first author 01 good conjectures, but very careless indeed to
give Guyet 1118 due praise? It is true, Guyet was nothing more than ingenious, a
true French nature in this respect; his judgment never ripened and Ι can easily
fancy that Bentley could not think much of him. His words 011 Davies may be
well applied to Guyet ‘ laudo equidem conatum et inqenio tuo faue0, quod ubi semel
maturuit, praeclarissimos fructus dabit. sed opus est iudicio subacto’ (note on Cic.
Tusc. 11 25). Guyet reached the age of 80 years, but his iudicium was never
subactum. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to possess his book ‘de prosodia
uersuum Terentii et Plauti: which his sudden death did not allow him to finish.

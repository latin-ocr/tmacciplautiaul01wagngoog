The theory that the natural accent of the Latin was, in the earliest
period of Latin poetry, an important factor in versification, which
decided its whole character, was first established by Bentley in his
‘ schediasma! Nevertheless, Bentley could not establish this theory
without allowing a difference between natural and metrical accent in
the first and last dipodieS, because without this liberty it would have
been a mere impossibility to transfer Greek metres and versification
into the Latin language. Bentley had, of course, to correct a great
many passages in Terence which were against his theory, and correct
them he did undauntedly. His theory was adopted by G. Hermann
(el. d, m. p. 141), though with the admission that the poets to whom it
applied, did not seem to follow it consistently3 and the ,same theory is
the groundwork of Bitschl’s views as developed in the xv and xvl
chapters of the Proleyomena. In the versification of the comic writers,
Ritschl discovers a struggle between a merely quantitative metrical
accentuation and the real accent of every—day life. According to his
theory, the natural accent of the language still exercised great influence
upon the versification of Plautus and his contemporaries, while it was
entirely disregarded in the Augustan period, when a merely quantitative
system of versification became dominant.

An accurate examination of this theory is due to the joint labours
of Franz Ritter, A. Bockh, Weil and Benloew‚ and Corssen.

As no theory avails us anything, unless it be confirmed by un·
doubted facts, it will be useful to consider the following proportions

which we borrow from Oorssen. This scholar has computed the average

number of passages in which metrical and natural accent differ, for the
following poets:

α. I ambies.

In Plautus the average number is .................. Q.
Terence .............................................. Q.
Phaedrus .......................................... Q.

gustus ............................................. ἐι.

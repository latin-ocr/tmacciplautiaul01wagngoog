EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY. Ι 3 5

.’ 527 . On maetam and the use of this word in Plautus and Terence -

it suffiees to refer to Parry’s note on Ter. Phorm. v 8, 39. mac-tm
is derived with the suffix tu from ma9-, the root of may-nus: see Gota-
sen, Im't. beibr. p. 423. —malum wretched life, damnwn unneoessary
expense.

529. edi ‘I have devoured! Thornton compares Shakespeare,
Otheuo 1 3‘ She’d come aqain and with a βαθείῃ ewr Devowr up my dis-
eoarsa' Plautus uses a similar expmssion cist. 1v 2, 54 mihi cibus est
quod fabulam, and Haut. 1062 quma-e eqo eius sermonem uolo. In
Greek ve have similar phrases: φαγεῖν ῥήματα in Aristophanes, and
εὗωχεῖσθαι λόγους in Plato. Megadorus' question ain audiuisti would
not furnish any reason against the truth of the reading edi.

530. For the hiatus in this line see Introd. p. Lx, usque a: note
on v. 248.

531. This line might be metrically, though awkwardly, explained:
tame m6 Ι quid &nilmo aliqum2tofaci1as reostius, but there are important
reasons to suspect the genuineness of the reading: see erit. note.

532. uitellus is here synonymous with laxatus or splendidus: thus
Plautus says Pseud. 77 4 oua-am: nitidiuscule and oisc. 1 1,10 lepide atque
nitide accipere. In Hor. ep. 1 4, 15 me pinquem et nitidam, bem ewrata
etde uisos the word has its original sense.

5:33. pro ‘in proportion to, in accordanee with? see Key, 1.. G.
ᾗ 1 361 g. Gronovius appropriately compares Hor. serm. 1 2, 19 pro
quaestu sumptum facit ‘ he lives up to his income.’—-9loria show, pomp,
parade: comp. Hor. ep. 1 18, 22 qloria . . supra urb-es et uestit et unqit.
The qloffre of the Freneh nation is very frequently qloria in this sense of
the Latin word. Thornton uses in his translation the proverb to mot

534. habere absolutely used ‘ to possess, to be rich :’ comp. Tmo.
1v 2, 3. .

541. senatus ‘ a consultation‚’ comp. G'lor. 592 and 594. Terence
does not, of course, use this expression.

542. The double s in aoeusswem is here found in Β and should
therefore be preserved: thus we have accus-sasso in the lex Iulia municiss
palis, and casus-sa is frequent for eausa: see Gorssen, aawspr. 1, 116. ι

544. For the genitive furum see Key, L. G. § 941. In the same
way conplere has the genitive after it Amph.. 1 2, 8 s. Mem. 901. replere
Poen. 111 3, 88.-mihi at the end of the line is pleonastie, but seems·
sufficiently exeused by the excitement of the speaker.

545. It would have been possible to keep mihi as the MSS. give it
and to shorten the first syllable of intro (qui mihi imo-ok see note on
v. 448 and 391. Oomp. also v. 550.—quinqentos denotes here a great

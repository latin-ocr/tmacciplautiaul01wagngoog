 

PREFACE. vii

ln tne introuucmon Ι nave chiefly „endeavoured 1-,0
give a brief, but clear. and sufficient summary of the laws
of Plautian prosody. This· seemed the more necessary as
the results of the investigatione of “ Ritschl and other
German scholare on this subject are either totally unknown
or, at the best, but partially known in this country, and
are moreover not easily accessible to the · English stu-
dent, they being scattered through Ritschl's Plautus and
prooemia, and many volumes of German philological
periodicals.

In concluding this preface‚ it gives me great pleasure
publicly to acknowledge the manifold obligations which
I owe to Dr. Ernest AdamS, who has not only kindly
touched my English style in many a sore part, but to
whose hints and· suggestions both the Introduction and
notes are greatly indebted.

Thus Ι dismiss my book, though I feel that it stands
in need of much indulgence and forbearance—I venture
to say that it would be better if Ι could have written

it at a place more favourable to philological studies
than Manchester.

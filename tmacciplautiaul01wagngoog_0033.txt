the plural <imus dtis, and appears therefore in its real quantity in the
passage alluded to. Thus we have suat and sciat in Plantae, and soleat in

Horace (Serm. 1 5, 90). It is the same with the imperfects ponebat (Eun.
Anu. 314), reuocabat (V erg. Aen. v 167), amittebat (ibid. v 853) ¹, and ertit
(Hor. Sat. 11 2, 47)⁹. It is the same with the ending et of the subjunc-
tive (both present and imperfect⁸), and even Horace has periret od. 111
5, 17. The ending et of the future belongs, of course, to the same series⁴.

Nay‚ even the it in the present of the so-called third conjugation
was originally long, e. g. Plautus has percipit Men. 921, and Ennius
ponit (A nn. 484). Hence we must not be surprised to find similar
unusual long vowels in Horace (afic Serm. 11 3, 260. fiqit od. 111 24, 5.
defendit Serm. 1 4, 82) and in Virgil (sinit Aen. x «133. facit Ecl. vn 23.
petit Aen. lx 9). An explanation of this quantity is given by Oorssen‚
ausapr. 1, 353: it will at once be understood by comparing the Latin

and Greek forms of λέγω and ἱερα-

λέγω 2695
λέγεις leyis or leqeis [ei = ῖ]“
λέγει(τ) ἶερῖι or leyen.

We find the same quantity again in the third pers. sing. perf. Once,
it is even expressed by the spelling ei = ῐ, Merc. 530, where the MS. A
gives redicit, and it is well proved by many instances in Plautus and
Terence ⁶, to which we have to add about eight different examples from
virgil, Horace and ovid—The same remark applies to the subjunctive

Lucian Miiller thinks that the passages from Virgil must be corrected ac·
cording to the authority of some MSS. See his observations on the whole

subject of lengthened endings, de re metr. p. 326—333.
⁹ The explanatione which comparative philology affords of the original long

quantity of these vowels, may be seen in Corssen, ausspr. 1, 349.
‚ ⁸ 1 may quote an instance of this quantity from the Pseudulus, v. 58:
cum eo simul me mitteret. ei rei dies

In this line, Bitschl and Fleckeisen insert leno after me and consider simul to be

monosyllabis. This word seems however not indispensably necessary, and 1 am
inclined to read the words in accordance with the MSS. Prof. Sauppe proposes to

read: cum εό simitu mitterer (ind. schol. Gott. 1825} p. 4).
⁴ Most of these originally long syllables were first pointed out by Fleckeisen,

⁶ The explanation of this fact is given by Prof. Key in his ⁴ Miscellaneous Re-

marks on Bitschl's Plautus' p. 184 ss.

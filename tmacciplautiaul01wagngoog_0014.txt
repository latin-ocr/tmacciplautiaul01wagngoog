added. It may be that only a few scholare will care for
the critical notes, but surely many students will desire to
have explanatory noteS, without which the edition would
to them· be quite useless. As it is my opinion that no
’ Latin author can be advantageously explained in the same
language, Ι have written my notes in English, though Ι

- am well aware that in so doing 1· must rely on the for-

bearance and kindness of my readers, who will, I hope,
not be very strict in the case of a foreigner whose ac-
quaintance with the English language is of no very long
standingL I may say 'that Ι have read 'and studied all
the commentaries ever written on the Aulularia, and
there scarcely can be anything of importance in them
which would not ‘be found in my notes. ⁶ But at the same
time, I have tried to avoid all unnecessary and super-
fluous erudition which seemed to have no connexion with
the explanation of the ‘text. On the whole Ι venture to
hope that a student will after the perusal of my notes
be sufficiently prepared for a critical study of the Plautian
,comedies I have not thought my commentary to be a

, ¹place wherein to mention the names of former commen-

tators whenever Ι am indebted to them for explanations
or quotations3 there is indeed a great deal of exegetical
matter running through all commentaries, and well-known
to every scholar; special mention has, however, been

. thought necessary in exceptional cases where peculiar

honour seemed due to the discovery of difficult explana-
tions or happy quotations Whether the original additions
and illustrations given in the present commentary will
be thought an improvement or not, Ι must leave to
my readers to decide.

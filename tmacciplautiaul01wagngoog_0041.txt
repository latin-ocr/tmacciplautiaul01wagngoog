still has the full forms muitum cauitor etc., as shown by Fleckeisen,
ep. mit. 111¹. In Plautus' time, we find the shortening process in
its full vigour and working3 in later times (and we must not forget
that there are more than 100 years between Plautus and Cicero)
those shortened vowels already began to be dropt. The conjecture
that after a consonante] u vowels first began to be dropt, the am-
biguous nature of this u giving rise to a diphthong‚ does not seem
without foundation.

Another instance of a shortened e in an imperative of the second
conjugation is tace? Aul. 325. Similarly we find

tend:

adimit animam mi asgritudo ε Stasime‚ tene me :2 uisne aquam?
Trin. 1091.

sin secus, patiemur animis aequis. tene sortem tibi
Cas. 11 6, 25.

v. 412 of the Aulularia furnishes us with a good example of the
variable quantity of such words‚‘ since we must there pronounce the
first tene as a pyrrhich, but the second as an iamb. A somewhat
analogous instance occurs in Ovid's line ‘ nali} wal& inquit et Echo' (see
L. Miiller, de re m. p. 308) ⁹. We may further enumerate doc& Aul.
431, uid& Trin. 763. Cas. 11 6, 26, and iube (see Bitschl Prole. CLXV).
It may be useful to add that the same quantity of the imperative -e
of the seo. conj. occasionally re-appears in the Augustan period,
ag. Ovid has sau& (am. 11 13, 21) and Ῐιααέ (am. 11 6, 62), Persius
(1 108) and Phaedrus (111 6, 3) have uida I may be allowed to quote

¹ We may add that even caueto would seem to follow this analogy in two
Plautian lines:

mox quom Sauream imitabor, caueto ne suscenseas.
Asin. 11 2, 105.

atque horunc uerborum causa caueto mi iratus fuas.
Capt. 11 3, ¹71:

These passages are, however, very doubtful and have justly been altered by

1³10ng Shhlsameter in a late sepulchral inscription in Burmann's Anthology gives

the same prosody (11 p. 154):
semper perpetuo nale, mi carissime coniux.

See Jo. Schrader’s Emendationes, p. 218.

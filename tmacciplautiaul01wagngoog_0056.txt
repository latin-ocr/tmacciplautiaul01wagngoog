xlii ’ INTRODUCTION.

was frequently doubled¹, there being almost no difference between the
pronunciation of a single or a double l’. Plautus, who wrote ile, had,
therefore, unlimited licence to lengthen the i (i. e. to assume a slower

and weightier pronunciation of the l as ll) wherever sentence or metro
seemed to require it, or to shorten it, in case the word should not be

of much importance. In fact, the short ‚pronunciation of the i in ille
occurs in Plautus in more passages⁸ than that quantity in which this
word always appears since the prosody of the Latin language was
entirely reformed and fixed by Ennius’ dactylic poetry.

The superlative simillumae has a startling quantity in a line in the

Asinaria (241),

portitorum simillumae sunt ianuae lenoniae.

But if seen under this point of view, we understand this seeming
irregularity at once. Plautus himself who wrote similumae was at
entire liberty either to say simillwmae, or in drawing the accent back
on the first syllable to shorten the second, which was the less objection-
able, because the ll (according to the later spelling) had indeed a very

weak sound⁴.
In the same way, the word satellites must be read caelites in a line

of the Tvinwnvmue (833).

¹ See the instances collected by consen, auespr. 1, 81. For Polio Pollio, Popi-
lius Popillius, see Ritschl’s note on the life of Terence by Suetonius, in Reiffer-
sheid’s edition of the fragments oi Suetonius, p. 512.

² In the name Achilles the i appears short in the first line oi the prologus to the

pommus ⁶ Achssem Aristfirchi mihi conmentari lubet.

:the spelling Aelium stands thus in Bc and the short quantity οι tho i may be
defended by a line from Plautus’ Mercator (488) 'Achillem orabo, ut aarum 'mihi det,

Hector qui expensae suit. For this line see BiicheIer, rhein. mue. xv 435. and on
the whole question M. Graiu, plaut. stud. p. 13. We may compare the two forms
’Δχιλλεύς and Ἀχιλεύς as found in the Homeric songs.

⁸ Abundant examples will be found in Corssen, auespr. 2, 76—80.

⁴ For this, and the following instance, see Corssen, ansepr. 2, 120.—Brix com-
pares (ed. of the Trin. nachtr. p. 113) the spelling sacilumed in the SC. de Bacanali-
bus.—All those scholars who believe in an entire harmony between the natural and
metrical accent in the versification of the comio poets cannot of course credit the
short quantity of the second syllable in simillumae. They will consequently save
the long quantity by pronouncing smillumae. We believe, on the contrary, that in
this one passage the syllable in question was rhythmically shortened‚ and we may
compare the analogous case of sayna, which will be mentioned hereaitet.

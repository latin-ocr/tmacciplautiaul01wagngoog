285. Congrio replies that he meant operam darre v. 282 in 0 different
sense, not obscenely as Antrax would insinuate. —aliouoreum dicere .·
comp. Ter. Ewn. 1 2, 2 aliouorsimn accipere.

286. istuc is here adverb = istoc, see Key, L. G. ξ 366.÷Stro‘bi1us in-
tends to avoid all further quarrel and says therefore sed crus dvc. ‘but to
come to the point, my master is going to marry.’ For this usage of scd ⁶
see Zumpt § 739.

289. liuius is here monosyllabic = huis, see Introd. p. Lvn. ’

291. ‘ Do you mean to say that you are going to send one half here,

· 293. The same expression filiai nuptiis occurs v. 370. 532. 790. Ι11
these three passages the MSS. rightly omit in, which must· be omitted,
since the final i in filiai cannot be elided: comp. Lachmann, Lucr. p.
161. In this passage we areat liberty to take nuptiis either as a dative
or an ablative (see Key, L. G. ξ 992. Zumpt ξ 475), but in the others it
must be ablative. ,

295. This was a proverbial expression, comp. Persa 1 1, 41 aquam
e pumice postulas qui ipsus eiciat and Pseud. 73 pumicci oculi—For
cta-iebus see the commentators on Ter. H aut. tim. 111 2, 15 scd habet
pavrem quendam auidwm. miserum atque aridum. It* is frequently used
to denote the nature of the pumice-stone, e. g. Oatull, l, 2. Martial v111
·7 2. pumex generally is a masculine, but sometimes we have it also as
a feminine, see Priscian VI 712 (R), 0. 3. in Catull. 1, 2 we should read
mida modo pumice expolitum, not arido (Haupt, quaest. Cat. p. 6).
Servius 011 Αο11. X11 587 ‘ pumicem autem iste (Vergilius) masculino qcncrc
posuit, ct hunc sequimur,· nam eb Plautus ita dixit’ seems to allude to
this passage in the Aulularia. ,

strobi lus tells him. See Zumpt ξ 237.

297. quin here and v. 300 11100118 ‘evenz ’see Zumpt ξ 542. If

noun qui and the original negation πω 111 the first, it is 15110 Ᾰ111150110-
gative qui and nc. In· translating it by ‘why,’ we may preserve its
original meaning.

94*- EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY:

nius Piso senati, Cato fructi, Sisenna senati soniti, Salustius tumulti
sortiti! ·

84. The word inania, instead of inanitae, probably owes its origin
to nothing more than the assonanoe of arama. The ὄξῦμωρον ‘ full of
emptiness’ ean hardly be imitated in any modern language, so as to
preserve its entire strength of expression. Plautus ventures on a
similar phrase Capi. 111 ’1, 6 where the parasite calls a fast-day dies
ecfertussawoe. Catullus uses a similar expression (8, 48) plenus sacerdus
est arammm,-and the same is found in a line of Afranius (Ribb. Com.
p. 184) amne ‹za-cula tua plenast ast-amarum 2 Hence we may safely
eonolude that this simile was proverbially used in popular speech.

85. mirum quin : ‘ I wonder, Jove does not make me a wealthy
king! Oomp. Persa 339 s. mirum quin reqis Philippi causa aut Attali Ι te
potius nendum quam ntea, quae sis mea? Brix (on Trin. 495) draws a
nioe distinction between mirum quin and mirwm ni.- the first pre-sup-
poses a negative, the latter an affirmative thought.

86. King Philippus and Darius are here mentioned as the most
obvious and best-known instanoes of wealthy kings, the one as a
European, the other as an Asiatic monareh. Comp. 696 eqo sum ille
rex Philippus. For the usual quantity of Philippu in Plautus see In-·
trod. p. xm, but in both passages of the Aulularia the eommon quantity
seems well supported by the best MSS. Hare however conjectures
Pkdippwm reqem aaut Dan-ium, teruene‘fica. The word teruemfflue ooours
Baeck. 813: both forms bri- and ter- have their analogies and either of
them is a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

87. ‘Ao-anea dwm a mpevimibaefilwm ducit, spem venturae pecuniae
avdetm- afferre! Ioannes Saresberiensis Polior. 1 13 F. (For other
superstitious beliefs with regard to spiders see Pliny, N. H. 11 24, 84.
and L Grimm, deutsche mytholoyie, 3rd ed.‚ p. 1089). Thornton observes
‘ Some of the Commentators, according to their usual refinement, would

have us to suppose that Euclio expresses his desire of having the spiders ·

preserved? because the ancients reokoned it a good omen, if a spider
eame spinning down in their presenee. But this totally destroys the
whole humour of the passage, which is palpably intended as a strong
mark of Euclio's sordid disposition? I cannot see why the humour of
the passage should be destroyed by supposing Euclio to be superstitious
as far as money is eoneerned. We may compare v, 616 ss., where
Euclio openly gives vent to his superstitious feelings. Still it is best to
say neither too little nor too muoh with regard to such passages as this
it being possible that Euclio intends to allude to a current popular
superstition, though we may understand the passage even without
assuming such an allusion.

ponius quoque in myas nuptam quaquam⁹ Ribbeck (com. p. 214)
gives only the words nuptam quaquam, though quaquam is quite unin-
telligible without the myas. What in meane, it is impossible to say.
In the passage quoted from Lucretius (Ι 428) by Forcellini, the genuine
reading is quoquoem.—numquaan quaquam is a very strong negation
‘ never by any means? Oomp. numquam quicquam Amph. 11 2, 40.
mmnquoem quisquam Ter. Eun. Π 4, 11. See moreover Ter. Andr. 1 2,
3. Ad. 1 2, 18. 1v 1, 12. v 4, 1.

105. For animi we may compare the following expressions dis-
crucior animi Ter. Ad. lv 4, l (= 640 Fl.) Antipho me excruciat animi
Phorm. 1 4, 10 (= 187). cxcv-rhetias am'mi Plaut. Glor. 1068 and 1280.
oenqas te animi Epid. 111 1, 6. in spe pendebit cmimi Ter. Haase. tim.
Π 4, 5 (=727)‚ where the genitive must not be joined with spe, see
Plaut. Mero. 1 2, 18 (=127 R.) amima· pendeo and Parry’s note on the
passage. Cicero uses the same expression Tuae. disp. 1 40, 96 pendemus
animi, eoecruciaanum anqimwr .· but there animi is due to an emendation
by Ursinus, the MSS. giving waimis. In another passage, ruso. 1v 16,
35 the reading of the MSS. is as follows is qui adpropinquans aliquod
malum metuit, exanimatquae pendet animi. We have to range under
the same head such instances as falsus animi eet Ter. Eun. 11 2, 43, where

the reading animi is expressly mentioned by Donatus, though the MSS.
give animo: comp. me 'ammi fallit Lucr. 1 922. In the same way we
have uayus animi Cat. 63, 4, which is the old Italian emendation of
the MS. reading ammte,· Lachmann writes animi-9, and Haupt accord-
ingly has so in his edition. dubius amimi Verg. Georq. 111 289. Parry
(on Ter. Eun. 11 2, 43) adopts the old-fasbioned opinion that this use of
the genitive was an imitation of the Greek idiom ψευσθῆναι γνώμης etc„
but this would be against the habit of the comio writers which entirely
forbids them to introduce any Grecisms into their language. We may
therefore conclude that this usage was as old and original in Latin as it
is in Greek. For the explanation of this genitive see Key, L. G. ἕ 935.
Ι cannot, however, agree with Prof. Key in so far as he considers <inimi
to be an old dative (ξ 952) which, 116 says, was afterwards mistaken for
a genitive and gave rise to the erroneous use of other genitivos in the
same sense. If this were so, we should have to recognise such mistakes
already in Plautian language, e. g. Trin. 454 satin tu ’s sanus mentis aut
animi tui, a passage which is ‘ evidently corrupt' according to Prof. Key,
thqugh it has been left unsuspected by Lindemann, Bitschl, Fleckeisen
and Brix: but far from being corrupt, this passage and another of the

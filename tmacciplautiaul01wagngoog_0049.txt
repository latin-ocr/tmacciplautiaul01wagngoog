the comic poets‚ we mention the form decb-o, which in an inscription

from Pesaro stands as an equivalent to dederunt. This form is an
unmistakeable precursor of the corresponding Italian form dieder01.

The final letters m 8 r t d are more frequently dropt than two
others which we have yet to mention. The first is l, which is some-

times cut off in the word semol (simul), e. g. Aul. 617. Glor. 1137.
Ter. Eun. 11 2, 10. Haut. tim. IV 5, 55 ἐ the second π, which is dropt
in the word twmen in such passages as Glor. 585. Ter. Hec. v 4, 32.

Ad. 1 2, 65. Eun. v 2, 50. These two cases are, however, not generally

acknowledged⁸. Sometimes the final n is dropt in such forms as royan
uiden iuben etc.

Α It may finally be observed that all monosyllabic prepositions occa-
sionally drop their final letters, e. g. in should be pronounced as i
C‘apt. 1v 2, 97. Poen. 1v 2, 82. 2, 13. 5. and oftener 3 ab as ἄ, and in

the same way we might explain the short quantity of ex (e. g. Stich.
716. Mero, 17 6.) though in many cases it suffices to assume the soft
pronunciation of x = 8⁴. This would explain the short quantity of
senem in such lines as Aac. 293. ‘

senex obsonari filiai· nuptiis,

but we should entirely drop the x in such lines as Rud. prol. 35
senex qui huc Athenis exsul uenit, hafi malus

¹ See Coi-ssen, ausspr. 1, 71. The secondary form oi the 3 pers. plur. perf. ere
instead of eram owes its origin to the same process.

² These instances are taken from Corssen, ausspr. 2, 96. Corssen contends
(amspr. 1, 79) that a final l was never dropt on account of its marked pronunciation.
He assumes therefore what he calls an ‘ irrational' pronunciation of the vowel of the
first syllable. Ι do not hesitate to adopt Guyet’s view as given in his note on Ter.
Eun. 11 2, 10 “ro l in simul eliditur, ut ultima syllaba corripiatur. idem factum
Hecyrae ιν 1 ...... idem et in senario illo Turpffli apud Nonium Marcellum [Bibb.
Gom. p. 94 v. 194] simul circum spectat.- ‘abi praeter se neminem. apud Plautum
(ἔαρι. ιιι 4, 19 [551 Fl.] ibidem τὸ l in procul eadem causa elisum est in septenario:
protn tu ab istoc pr6cul recedas...’ This is the reading in BJ‚ which Fleckeisen
would certainly keep now, if he were to revise his first volume. At present he
gives apscedas instead os recedas. Surely, Gorssen would not say that the ο in procul
was irrational.

⁸ The dropping of the final n in tamen may be inserted from the passages ffl‘ven
above (we are indebted for them to Corssen, ausspr. 2, 95); but not from Festus
p. 360 ⁸ antiqui tam etiam pro tamen usi sunt‚’ since Corssen shows (krit. beitr. zur
lat. forment. p. 273-279) that the passages quoted by Festus do not prove that tam
was ever used as an equivalent for tamem—In the Umbrian dialect we find nome ior
nomen (Aufrecht u. Kirchhost, umbrische sprachdenkmaler 2, 407)-

⁴ See Gorssen‚ ausepr. 1, 125. 2, 473.

and fluctuating system of latin prosody was afterwards entirely re-
formed by Ennius. He , could not violently alter what had already
become the acknowledged usage of the language, but in all such cases as
were not yet finally settled, the quantity preferred by him ‚remained
valid for all after-times. But a full discussion, of this point would lead
us beyond the limits of this Introduction: at present we, think it
sufficient to refer to Miiller, de re metr. p. 69 and 70. ‚

We may conclude this section with the words of Marius Victorinus
(p. 25 6>: Comici dum cotidianum sermonem imitwri nituntur, metra
uitiant studio, non inperitia, quod frequentius apud nostroe quam Grae-
cos invenimus.

F. SYNIZESIS. .

The notion of synizeeie rests on the ambiguous nature of the two
letters u and i, which may both be used as vowels and consonante, and'
are in the latter quality commonly expressed by v and j ¹. To these
two we have to add the letter e, which sometimes assumes the conso-
nant-sound of i (y). This is the case in the word deus, where we have
dei = di even in common Latin ², but in the comio writers we find deo
(Ploeat. oisc. 1 3, 2. Liv. Andr. traq. Ribb. v. 9) and deos (Nam. οοηι.
Ribb. 95. Plaut. Amph. 1 1, 128. 11 2, 86. v 1, 38. 41. Aac. 1v 10,-
12. 13. Capi. 111 5, 69. Cure. 1 1, 70. 11 2, 13. v 2, 58. Cas. 11 5, 28.
38. 11 6, 37. 44. eisc. 11 3, 52. 1v 1, 12. Epid. 11 2, 117. v 1, 4. and
in many other passages) as monosyllableS. The genitive dei occurs wit-h·
a monosyllabio pronunciation *only once, Ribb. Tray. p. 202, deae
follows this analogy (Aul. 778. Cas. 11 4, 1. Uist. 11 1, 35. Epid, 111
3, 15. Most. 1 3, 35. Pseud. 1 1, 35. 1 3, 36. Poe‘n. 111 3, 54. lv 2, 37.
v 4, 102. Persa 11 4, 21. 25. 27. v 2, 50). In the same way deorum
is disyllabic in many instances (Amph. prol. 45. Epid. v 2, 10. Bacch.
124. Men. 217. Εαεῖ. 11 2, 13). This fact may be compared with the

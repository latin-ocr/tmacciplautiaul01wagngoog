In the first instance (Glor. 361) allaeuam is still visible‚ but has been
corrected and changed into ad laeuam. From this one example, we
may reasonably suspect that other instances of the same spelling were
frequently found in the archetype of Β, which were, however, obliterated
by later revisions. Now, this spelling is prevalent in J, i. e. proclicics

cmd enclitics aste qenerally written toyether with their respective words, ⁶

although I do not remember having found such assimilatione as in the five
instances quoted from other MSS. The same is observed in the MS.
of Cicero's Tusculans and the extract from Isidor referred to, and in a
curicus MS. of the fourth book of Martianus Capella (Harleioenus 3825,
saec. lx). Prof. Key reports the same of a MS. of Livy in the British

Museum, though unfortunately he does not state its probable age ¹. 1
have no doubt that many other MSS„ if closely inspected, would show
the same peculiarity of spelling. Its antiquity is proved by its fre-
quent occurrence in ver)r old inscriptions and by the testimonies of
Priscian, Servius and even of Quintilian 1 5, 27: ‘cum dico circum
litora, tamquam unum enuntio dissimulata distinctione, itaque tam·
quam in una uoce una est acuta.- quod idem accidit in illo.- Troiae
qui primus ab·oris.' Priscian says p. 977, ‘own annitatur saepe prae-
positio sequenti dictioni et quasi una pars cum ea αἰενάων] The whole
subject has been treated by Censen, uber ammach, vokaliemus und
betonuny der lateinischen spraclze 11. p. 254—321, where ample matter
will be found to convince even the most incredulous of the truth of the

assertion that pronouncinq such words as one was the invem-table practice
qf the best times of the Latin lanquaqe, and that this was frequently
expressed by writinq them toqetlaer'.

¹ See Addendum to Key's Latin Grammarg 1465.

² The subject is, however, not yet exhausted, at least not so far as it touches
Latin versification. It is my opinion (as will appear from the second part of this
Introduction) that Latin poetry was, from the very oldest times down to the period
of its extreme degeneration, under the absolute dominion of quantity .- still, it can·
not be denied in Latin poetry the common accent was of greater influence than in
Greek. A careful observation of the enclitics and proclitics of the Latin would, no
doubt, throw much light on many passages where we now consider metrical accent
to be different from the common pronunciation of Latin prose. Prof. Key has some
excellent remarks on this head in a Paper ‘ on Greek accentuation’ (Transactiom os
the Philoloqical Society 1855 p. 135 ss.)

‘1 2 8 ·EXEGET10AL COMMENTARY.

456. in malam rem abire, in mlam crucem or in malu'm maedam
'abire are all expressions of the same kind ‘ to go to the d—.’

458. For the hiatus rem habere see Introd. p. mn.

462. In all the passages where condique occurs, it gives the expres·
sion a sarcastic or ironical colouring: e. g. Pom. 11 ·17 condique Ιια-
mepex, non homo trioboli—aiebat portendi mihi i.e. what else could
I have expected? Cas. 1 1, 43 noctu m condique te cubes (i. e. very
badly) curabitur. See also Bacch. 392. Men. 9063 only Cape. 1 2, 22
the adverb has no ironical sensa—qauifflaem is the quantity of this
word in Plautus, Lucilius, Titinius (126 Ribb.) ‘and Phaedrus: see
Lachmann on Lucr. p. 36. I should however have adopted the spelling
yallinacius which is found in ιΪγ and indicated by yallinatius in B: for
this is the actual reading of that MS„ according to Schwarzmann’s
collation. Biicheler (rhein. mus. xx 441) quotes the spelling yallinacius
from the best authorities in Varro Ὅνος λ. 11, Cicero Mur. § 61, Phae-
drus 111 12, l, Petron. 86 and an inscription Orelli 4330. In the
same way we have the solitary formation niv-acius in a fragment of
‘Varro's Meleaqer (see Riese, rhein. mus. xxl 121).

463. In some editions the perverse scansion qui erat anui peculiaris
is found, though this violates the legitimate quantity of mian&-
anui sh'ould be pronounced and perhaps written as anu: for the contracted
form of the dative see Gellius 1v 16 non omnes concedunt in casu da-
tiuo senatui maqis dicendum quam seowtu. sicut Lucilius in eodem casu
uictu et anu dicit, non uictui et anui... Verqilius quoque in dandi casu
aspectu dicit, ‘non aspectui. In the same way as here the MSS. give
sumptui Tria. 250, where in scanning the line we should either substi-
tute sumptu or swmpti. But still it would be better to write anu, just
as we do not hesitate to write fide, where the metre would not bear
fidei.—The adverb paenissume recurs v. 660. That the first syllable
should be spelt with a diphthong‚ appears from Priscian who in two
passages declares paen-issima to be the superlative of paene: see Ritschl’s
note on Most. 656. This derivation is also borne out by the meaning
‘ very nearly?

464. The spelling scalpumre stands not only in ιῐγ, but in B
too (see p. Lxx) and should therefore be admitted into the text. ⁴⁰ The
word appears to be a ἅπ. λεγ.; it is by no means a desiderative, in
which case the u would be short and we ought to have wulpem-ire (as
indeed most editors perversely read: conf. also scalpturio κατακνάω Gloss.
Labb. p. 165), but it is of the same formation as liyumire and scaturire

§ZZ'umpt 4§ 2132): for liqurmlre (not liqna-ire) see Bentley’s note on Ter.
un. v ‚ . .

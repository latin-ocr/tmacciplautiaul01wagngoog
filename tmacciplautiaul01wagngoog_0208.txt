altae, and even this would not be exactly the same, since non and nec
precede. Unfortunately the reading of J cannot be ascertained in this
place. cenaene is at all events a very easy and correct alteration.

359. postulem is in the language of the comic poets frequently an
- equivalent for uelle or cupere,· thus we may translate here ‘would you
have us burn our housei’ Hence we should explain the following in-
finitivo. For instances see v. 581. capt. 111 5, 59 81. Cas. 1 53.
Tmo. 1 2, 393 with the whole sentence comp. Cape. Iv 2, 64 s. quid me,
uelum-i, Tuan catuna aedis incensurum cemes?

361. intem-aiem ‘I'll go and see τ’ see on v. 200.

Ι364. For >inde see Introd. p. XLV.

365. deorsum according to the invariable practice of Plautus is .
disyllabioz see Introd. p. LIL—-The word does here apparently not mean
⁸ downwards‚’ but ‘ down! Forcellini gives one instance for this sense,
Varro de re rust. 111 5 deorsum in terram est aqua quam bibere possint.
Another example is given by Douza: Varro de re rust. 1 8 qui colunt
deors-am, maqis aestate laborem& qui sursum, maqis hieme. Cicero too
has swewm in the sense ‘higher upz' de nat. deor. II 56, 141, nares...
recte sursum sunt. .
⁸ 368. rapacida is a comical formation after the analogy of Pelopida

Aeacida and other patronymics. Plautus has the similar words playi-
patidae Capt. 111 1, 12 and collicrepidae mwicrepidae Trin. 1022.
-The e in siet has here preserved its original long quantity: see Introd.
p. xlx.

369. Euclio had been to the market to get some little matters for
his daughter's nuptiale, but found everytbing too expensive.—With
,animm con ‘re comp. affirmaffe animwm Merc. 81.

373. With porcindm comp. pistillzim v. 95.

374. Thornton rightly translates ‘what made them dearer still, I
had no money.’ Δ

37 6. For ita mie see Introd. p. Χῖαι-111 bmmfbvis the final syllable
is long: see Introd. p. xv11. It might be said that it would be possible

, to read -omzibzis ad- as a tribrach, but Plautus would never let the ac·

cent fall on the last syllable of a dactylic word: see Ritsehl, Pron. ccxnx.
-adire manum is not unfrequently found in Plautus (e. g. Poen. 11 11.
Persa v 2, 18. Cas. v 2, 55) in the sense ‘to deceive, to impose upon.’
Acidalius justly observes that the phrase seems to have arisen from
some artifice practised in wrestling.

377. inter uias ‘while I was walking home.'

378. Thornton translates ‘ feast to-day makes fast to-morrow.'—
die is here a monosyllable: Introd. p. LVIII.

379. Comp. Hor. serm. 11 3, 143 s. qui Veientcmum festis potua-e

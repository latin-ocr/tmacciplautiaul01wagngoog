 

mmonoo‘rlow. 'xxi

1 shall first speak of the final vowels occasionally shortened in the
rapid pronunciation of the times between the second and third Punic
wars.

The long a of the first declension was not only shortened in the
nom. and voc. (as it remained indeed ever afterwards), but even in the
ablative, e. g.

' pro mala uita famam extolles, pro bona partam gloriam
Ennius ed. Vahlen p. 94.

The same happened to the o of the dat. and abl. sing. of the second

declension‚ e. g. the abl. domo stands as a pyrrhich in the following
two instances: ’

unde exit? :2 unde nIsi dom6 z: domo? :x me uide t: etsi uideo
Glor. 376 ¹.

domo quem profugiens dominum apstulerat, uendidit.
Gapt. prol. 18.

In the abl. ioco the final o is shortened Bacch. 75, where the read-
ing of the MSS. is as follows:

simulato me amare :z utrum ego istuc iocon adsimulem an serio?
and so Fleckeisen gives the line, while Ritschl writes

utrum eyo ioc6n id simulem an serio.

ero (dat. of erus, master) stands as a pyrrhich Aul. 584 and Most. 948.
ὂοηό is another example of the same kind:

haec erit bono genere nata, nss scit nisi uierfim loqui
Persa 645 .

malo falls under the same head ε

malo mammo suo hercle ssico. ubi tantulum peccassit
. Cas. tv 4, 6.

set etiam nuum hoo ex ingenio mssssaozgglum inueniant suo
. 546.

caue sis malo. quid tn malum nam me
Rud. rv 3, 12.

In the last passage, Fleckeisen alters the metre hy inserting nunc
after nam.

¹ See Bitschl, praef. Stich. xvn.
² In this passage, Ritschl gives bono without the mark of ecthlipsis (Proll.

cxmv), i. e. he considers the final ο to be shortened.

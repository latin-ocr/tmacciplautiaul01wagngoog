occasion to speak of Plautian passages and to emend them. RitschL
whose name will be connected with that of Plautus for ever, declares
in his dedication of the Prolegomena to the Trinummus‚ that, next to
the great Bentley, he considers Gottfried Hermann (whose pupil he was
at Leipsic) as the sole guide in the emendation of Plautus. This
admits, however, of many restrictione. Ritschl does by no means follow
the same principles through his whole Plautus. Many facts which he
did not acknowledge in his Prolegomena, were admitted in the prefaces
to the different parts of the second and third volumes‚ some even were
silently given up. What Bitschl now holds as to Plautian prosody
etc.‚ is developed in an excellent paper in the ‘rheinische museusm' vol.
xlv p. 400 ss„ and the proofs of his views are partly to be found in the
numerous ‘prooemia‚' which he had to write twice every year while
professor at Bonn. In the following sketch‚ Ritschl's present theories
have been followed throughout, with the sole exception of our doctrine
of the influence of the accent on Latin poetry‚ where we follow the
views briefly developed by B'ockh (berit-ht der berliner akad.- der wis-
sensch. 1854 p. 270 se.) and more fully proved by Corssen in his book

on Latin pronunciation.

But to return to the two passages quoted from Oicer0‚—we need
not dwell upon the fact that for a full appreciation of Plautian metres
and prosody‚ we must have a just idea of the oldest pronunciation of
the Latin. A search after this will not fail to throw much light on the
oldest history of the Latin language 3 it will, at the same time, show that
many forms now found in the so-called Romanic languages were already
anticipated in the popular speech of the times of Plautus and Terence.
This accounts for the otherwise surprising fact that many of the
youngest forms of the Latin language are either perfectly identical with
the oldest forms or must at least be traced back to the same explanation.
This point is duly appreciated and even somewhat overvalued in a
paper ‘ On the metres of Plautus and Terence' by Prof. Key‚ which is
appended to his treatise on the Alphabet ¹.

¹ Prof. Key’s system of pronouncing Latin verses may be called a contr-active
one, since he makes use of a contracted pronunciation of certain words even where
metrical reasons (at least those generally accepted) would well admit the uncon-
tracted forms. E. g. Prof. Key tells us to read poeta camprim dm adscribend dp-

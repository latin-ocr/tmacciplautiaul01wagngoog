xxii INTRODUGTION.

The abl. modo (which must not be confounded with the particle)
stands as a pyrrhich Aul. 589:

68116111 1116ᾶὸ seruom ratem esse amanti ero aequom censeo

and Pseud. 569, where the MSS. give this reading¹,
nouo modo, nouom aliquid inuentum adferre addecet.

In this case, the words nouo modo are to 116 taken as a proceleusma-
tic, a foot which is very frequent in the first place of a senarius (see
Ritschl, Prole. Trin. ocnxxxnt). With the same quantity we have in
the Tm'nummus 602

quo modo tu istuc, Stasime, dixti, nostrum erilem filium

Lachmann (on Lucretius p. 116) 66116 the short quantity of this o
‘ mirabile :' Prof. Key, to avoid the unwelcome acknowledgment of
such a fact, proposes the monosyllabic pronunciation mo, and to cor-

roborate this conjecture, he appeals to the Roman way of abbreviating
the word: mo (⁴Alphabet’ p. 141). But I may observo, that by abbre-

viating the orthographical appearance of a w'ord‚ nothing is insinuated
as to its pronunciation⁹. Prof. Key’s other argument is drawn from the
Romanic 16113116366, where quomodo appears in the shape of com como
come comme .· it would, no doubt, prove that quomodo really sounded
like quomo (como) in the latest period of the Latin language‚ but would
it explain the real nature of the general law whose slow but steady
working at last degraded full words and endings to p'oor cripples'l We
recognise in Plautian prosody the beginnings and the first germs of a
depravation of the Latin language‚ which came at last to a full develop-
ment in the Romanic languages. We shall, therefore, not hesitate to
explain Romanic forms from such shortened endings as we find in
Plautus, but we shall be very cautious in remodelling the pronuncia-
tion of Plautian forms after the analogy of Romanic forms. The
spirit of modern philology requires that the order of time should be

observed and teaches us not to blend the peculiarities of the different

glad to see that Fleckeisen does not follow his example.
² Is e. g. you would take the copy-books of a German student as a measure of

1116 pronunciation‚ you would arrive at a great many surprising discover-ies in
German pronunciation3 but Ι 6111 afraid, they would all be repudiated by the actual

pronunciation of those studente themselves.

way of a slight letter-change¹. The orthography of this MS. has been
adopted throughout, though modified with a due regard to manifest
errors which must be attributed to the period when it was written.
Pareus is generally pretty accurate in . this respect, though he is not to
be trusted throughout. Ritschl warns us in the preface to his first
edition of the Bacchides to draw conclusions from Pareus’ silence, and
Ι have endeavoured to observe this restriction‚ though there are several
passages where Ι found it impossible to ascertain the actual reading
of the MS.; in such cases Ι always quote the authority which is
responsible for the reading adopted in my text. Gruter, in his preface
to Taubmann's third edition, p. xiv, enumerates the following words
which Pareus generally spells against the custom of his time: corm'qere
prorsus herus hera plurima pessimus efficio efflictum succenseo sexcenta
simul heri swrreptum fidicina tibicina thesaurus ueto, spelt in Pareus'

edition conriqere prosus erus era pluruma pessumus ecficio ecflictmn
succenseo sescenta semul eri subruptum fidicena tibicena thensaurus uoto,
and Gruter charges Pareus with adopting these forms in his text even

where others actually occur in the MS. Now, it appears at once that
almost all these forms are actually older and more genuine than those
patronised by Gruter, and in not a few passages our commentary will
show that Pareus expressly states his. deviation from the MS. As to
the omissions with which Parcus is charged by Gruter, a careful com-
parison has convinced us that, for the most part, they are perfectly
groundless. There are, as far as we can prove, only two words in the
list given by Gruter, which Pareus seems to spell against the authority
of the MS„ viz. fidicena and tibicena. Ritschl's apparatus gives the spell-
ing fidicinas in B Most. 960, and in ABG Stich. 380, tibicina is found
in the Stichus, tibicinam in the Mostellaria and Pseudulus. Pareus has
fidicena et tibicena Stich. 1v 1, 36 (= 542 Ritschl), but Ritschl expressly
states fidicina et tibicina to be the spelling of the MSS. Nevertheless, the
present edition of the Aulularia gives the word always with an e in the
penult, because Pareus has the following note on 11 4, 2 ‘Tibice-
nasque] Sic V. O. a Pal. sext. at τὰ que non est in V. 02, and accord-

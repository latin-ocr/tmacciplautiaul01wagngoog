my ow'n ; we may only be allowed to ask for· the arguments which entitle
us to transfer the laws of English poetry to Greek and Latin metres 3
and these Ι cannot find in Prof. Key's paper.

140. amabo ‘pray2' see Parry’s note on Ter. Eun. 1 2, 50. It is

'ordinarily used parenthetically without influencing the construction of
the sentence.

141. For sia see note on v. 46.

143 Perhaps I should have given preference to the reading found
in J. aduenio. There rs no doubt that the frequentative aduenw, if taken
in its original nature, would here be entirely out of place. aduentare
would however seem to have lost. the sense of a frequentative, if the
reading in Poen. 111 l, 58 should be genuine: ubi is detulerit (tetulerit
Camerarius), tu ἑο quaesitum seruom aduente& tuom, but Ι ani inclined ’
to think that Bothe rightly reads seruom quaesitum aduenies tuom.
The only other Plautian passage in which the frequentative occurs, is
fflruc. 11 4, 51 (=401 Geppert) quoniam iam decimus mensis aduentdt
:po-ope, and there it may well be explained ‘ draws nearer every day.'
In Terence and the other comic writers, aduentu is not found, Ennius
uses it once in its frequentative sense, rell. ed. Vahlen p. 99. “

144. factum uolo ‘ est non comica magis formula quam trans-
·laticiae humanitatis. quod est: cupio tibi fieri quod uis, et quantum in
me est, ut fiat, operam dabo. Bacch. 495. Asin. 6853 J . F. Gronovius
ad Gen. vn 3. Compare Ter. Ad. v 7, 21. ΡῘιονηι. ·v 3, 4.

145. Lambinus first saw that the words liberie procreamdie could
not be explained grammaticali y and therefore transposed quod tibi sem-
piternum salutwre ait. ΜΕ. ita di faxint. Ev. liberis procrecmdie uolo
te uxorem. But the same result is obtained by supposing the loss of
two little words, as we have done. For the metrical constitution of the
whole passage see also p. van.

147. The words ita di faxint are frequently given to Megadorus,
but without any sufficient reason. Megadorus afterwards speaks, as if
he was totally disinclined to take a wife (149 S.): how then could he so
readily assent to his sister’s proposal which is indeed clearly worded?
Gruter observes ‘ potuit uel ioci causa. hoc interfari, tanquam scilicet
etiam liberos procreare liceret ex alia re quam feminiS,’ whereupon Gro.
novius justly replies ‘iocosi sunt qui nodum sic tollunt, ioco interfari
Megadorum.' There seems to be no doubt that these words belong to
Eunomia. For the phrase see v. 255. 781 s.

148. occidis] The present stands in this phrase Pseud. 931 'and
Men. 922, the perfect occidisti Aul. 712 and Ter. Phorm. 1v 3, 67.

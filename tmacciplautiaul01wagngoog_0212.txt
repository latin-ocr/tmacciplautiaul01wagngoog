1 2 2 BXEGETIGAL COMMENTARY.

quently mentions baec-bae: see Cae. v 4, 9 66. Mero. 469. (Vidular.
fragm. p. 483 Em.) Bacch. 371. 53. Amphibr. 11 2, 70 66. Glor. 1016.
Men. 834 ss. Pseud. 109 s. In Greek, βάκχαι 111 general means ‘furious
women,’ and the word has the same sense in Plautus, where we should
not always think of an allusion to the bacanalia so severely punished by
the senate. We must not therefore use this passage to fix the time
when Plautus wrote the Aulularia—The verb coquinatwm is attested
by N onius and given by our MSS. t it is therefore quite preposterous to
write aequitatum, as G. Hermann and Goeller dc. The same verb occurs
Pseud. 853 aaz ta eoq'u'lnatwm te ire quoquam postulas and ibid. 87 5
quami istae unum me coquinare peu-doces 5 In the dictionaries we gene-
rally find the wrong quantity coquina ,· but coqu-ina- is derived from
coqu- in the same way as car-inar- from cdr- (Sanskr. skar laedere): cari-
nare is used with this quantity by Ennius, Arm. 181 61111 229 2 although
Forcellini here again gives omna, while Freund rightly has carina. Ι
cannot at present compare Prof. Sauppe’s remarks on this point in the Ind.
schol. Gott. 1853 p. 10, where he likewise defends the short quantity of
the i in coquina. With 00166611, ὂοίιν. p. 451 6., Ι 110 not quite agree.

407. Congrio calls the inferior cooks (quinqemos coquos v. 545) his
‘disciplesss because he has to direct them what to do, In using the
plural comudemnt, Congrio continues in the simile of the bacchae,
just as if in Euclio all the Furias were represented together.

408. Instead of wood which was of course‘ a necessary article for
cooks, Euclio most liberally provides them with finces: onustus fhstibtoe
meaning ‘thoroughly thrashed.'—li9na praebere is known from Hor.
somn. 1 5, 46. Ι have adopted the original Plautian form of this verb
in my text praebibero which also shows the original derivation from

· prae and babere. This form rests on the authority of the best MSS. in

the following passages: Pseud. 182. 368. Mero. 543. 1022. Persa 510.
429. Rud. 1 2, 50. Men. 802. 979. Olor. 591: in all others we find
praeb. In the Proleqomena p. cv Ritschl makes the general observation
‘praebibere quam Plautus formam solam nouit: nam praebere in nouiciis
tantum libris extat,’ and again in the Ind. schol. aest. Bonn. 1854 p. vn
‘praeba‘bere forma constanter usum esse Plautum multa faciunt ut cre-
damus.’ Since this very form praehiberi is read thus Persa 510, not
even the most cautious critic would hesitate to replace it here against
the authority of the MSS. , and thus Fleckeisen gives praehiberi 01110. 11
2, 19, although the MSS. give praeberi. In the same way we find in
Plautus the original form debibeo instead of debeo, As to the metro,
the forms praebibere and debibere have quite the same value as if
written praebere and debere.- see our general remarks Introd. p. nx and
00166611, ausepr. 2, 181.

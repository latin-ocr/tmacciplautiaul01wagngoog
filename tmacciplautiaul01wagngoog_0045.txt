 

IN TRODUCTION . xxxi

“ tention of our readers to the two words quidem and enim, which must
frequently be pronouneed as quide and eni¹ (Aul. 209. 496 etc).

Even in later poetry, a final m was entirely disregarded‚ if the next
word began with a vowel, this being the last trace of a licence which
had formerly spread over a larger territory.

As to 8, we have a very memorable passage in Cicero's Orator
48, 161 quin etiam quod iasm subrusticum uidetur, olim autem politius,
eorum uerborum quorum eaedem erafnt postremae duae litterae quae
eunt in ‘ optumus’ postremam litteram detrahebant, nisi uocalis inee-
quebatur. ita non erat ea offensio in uersibus quam nune fuqiunt poetae
noui. ita enim loquebamur ‘ qui eet ommibu’ princepa' uon ‘ omnibus
princeps? et ‘ uita illa diqnu’ locoque,' non ‘ diyuue'.’

This licence is known to every reader of Lucretiae, and its exten-

sion may be shown by a line from Ennius’ Annales (601 Vahlen)
tum lateralis dolor, certissimus nuntius mortis.
Corssen (ausspr. 1, 119 s.) gives a list of 15 words from inscrip-

tions as old as the Punic ware, in which a final 8 is entirely omitted,

and the same fact occurs again in inscriptique of the decline of the

Roman empire. It would, therefore, be very surprising if no traces
of it were found in the verses of the comic writers, As instances of
it will be frequently met with in Plautus, we shall confine ourselves
to some examples from the Aulularia. Thus we should pronounce

minus :minu prol. 18. 19.
nimisque = nimique 61.

nimis = ‘nimi 493.

¹ Prof. Key (‘A1phabet’ p. 142), Ritschl (Proll. p. exn. cnm) and Bergk (zeit-
schrift fiir die alterthumswissemchaft 1848 p. 1130) assume a monosyllabic pronuncia-
tion of quidem and enim. It would be preposterous to deny the possibility of such a
fact‚—and indeed some arguments, especially one alleged for enim by Bergk—seem
strongly to point to it. But as it cannot be concluded from the evidence of Plautian
metres, we think it safer to follow a general theory which gives us an equally satis-
factory explanation, instead of assuming an exceptional pronunciation which would
after all not be supported by entirely undoubted arguments.

² The truth of Oicero’s observation ‘quam nunc suyiunt poetae noui’ may be
exemplified by comparing two lines of Ennius and virgil. In Vir-gil (Aen. ΧΠ
115) we read Solis equi lucemque elatis ‘naribus efflant, on which words Servius has
the following note ‘ Ennianus uersus est ordine commutato .· funduntque elatis naribus
lucem! (See Ennius ed. Vahlen p. 85 and the passage quoted there from Marius
Victorinus.) The reason which induced Virgil to change the order of the words
appears at once.

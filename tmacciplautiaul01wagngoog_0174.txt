EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY.

Pnomeus.

ΤΗΕ greater part of the Plautian prologues being spurious and pre·
fixed to the comedies of the poet long after his death, it is very
very doubtful whether the prologus to the Aulularia can be held to
have been written by the poet himself. It is true, none of the argn-
ments alleged against the rest of the prologues by Ritschl (Par. 1 209
-226) can be applied to this: ,on the contrary, this prologue is
remarkably distinguished for its simple grace and unaffected language.
As regards the question, whether it is necessary or not, we agree
entirely with Thornton who justly observes: ‘ There seems to be no
reason, why any account at all need be given for how many genera-
tions the treasure had remained undiscovered in the old miser’s family,'
though at the same time we must confess, that to give such infor-
mation no fitter person could be found than the Lar familiana.
Moreover, the introduction of this Deity is quite conformable to the
habit of the writers of the so-called New Comedy (see Meineke, Men.
et Philam. rell. 1823 p. 284) which Plautus seems to have followed
here as well as in the prologues to the Rudens and the TrinummuS.
On these grounds, I was first inclined to attribute this prologue to
Plautus himself (de Aulul. p. 29), but without taking into considera-
tion a metrica] reason subsequently suggested by Brix, viz. that the
writer uses the word auonclus v. 35 as quadrisyllabic, while Plautus
himself has it as trisyllabic <stimulus (v. 677. 772. 7 92), in accon-dauco
with a popular pronunciation which we find confirmed by some in-
scriptions (see Oorssen‚ ausspr. 1, 138). It seems therefore safer to
return to Bernhardy's opinion (ramisclae litteraturqeschichte, 1 865, p.
442) who ascribes this prologus to an older hand than the others,
though we may allow the universal character and even the whole idea

·32. For eibi uad—see Introd. p. xlv. In ,34-the word umor has
its original quantity.

36. Cereris uiqt‘liis] Lyconides himself confesses the same to
Euclio V. 787 s. ‘ The nocturnal festival of Ceres, θεσμοφόρια, uiqi-
liae Cereris, used to be celebrated by married and unmarried women
strolling about in the dark without any light, whence this opportu-
nity could naturally enough be misused by young men who liked to
encounter romantio adventures, The oomic poete are therefore quite
true to reality in founding the plots of some of their plays upon these
festivals, as e. g. Plautus does here and in his Cistellaria (where see
the prol. 8).’ Kopke. The same remark applies to the Dionysia or
Bacanalia which frequently gave riae to illegitimate offsprings: see Eur.
Ion 553 ss. , Cicero has several chapters against these licentious festi-
vals in his second book dc leqibus, where he especially mentions their
frequent occurrence in the comio poets, 11 14: quid autem mihi dis·
pliccat in sacris nocturnis, poc'tac indicant comici. See Davies‘ and
Turnebus' notes on de leq. 11 9 and 14.

38. conscia. In prose the dependent genitive is rarely omimd,
but in poetry the adjective is sometimes used absolutely, e. g Cistell-
11 3, 46 fac me consciam (‘ tell me’). Hor. serm. 1 2, 130 miseram so
conscia clamet.

39. subruptum and v. 347 submpias are the old forms for sab-
reptwm and subripias, which are frequently given by the best Plautian
MSS. and must therefore be uniformly introduced into the text. The
ἄ of rapere capere quatere calcare salire became originally u in com-
pounds‚ see Comen, ausspr. 1, 314. This u became stationary in* not
a few words, e. g. aucupor occupo percutio concutio conculco multo
‘in-sums and others. See Brix on Triu. 83, Munro on Lucr. 111 1031,
Biicheler observes (jahrbss fiir class. phil. 1863 p. 7 79) that these forms
occur even in such later writers as affect an archaic style, viz. Fronto
(fer. Ale. 3, 20 surmpuissct) and Seneca Rhetor (22, 1 B. subrupie‘ndi
and 333, 2 subrupuemm). Martini too has sum-upuib xm 38. These
examples show that the u- sound in this compound was never entirely
out of use. Gomp. moreover condemnem, as the word is once written

in the tabula Bwntina, and conmerm‘wm from tabeo-na.

Corssen, ausspr. 2, 7 says that it belongs to the popular dialects of later
Latinity, and 2, 348 he quotes an Umbrian form anle. The only pas-
sage which might be quoted in support of anylus, is in the poem de pon-
deribus sometimes ascribed to Priscian, but commonly attributed to
Q. Rhemmius Fannius Palaemon, v. 59 = Poet. lat. min. ed. Burmann 2,
401 ‘pes lonqo spatio latoque notatum in amylo, Anqulus ut par sit,’ but
there we should write et aleo according to a conjecture of Vinet.

433. The spelling sequius is repeatedly found in the old writers in
the place of the common forms secius or setius. The quantity of the e
in se· is somewhat doubtful: Fleckeisen holds it to be short, on account
of a line of Afranius (Ribb. Gom. rell. p. 170), where however the long e
would do equally well: see Gorssen, krit. beitr. p. 7. Oorssen considers
this line of the Aulularia to be an iambic septenarius: quid fecimus,
quid diximus tibi sequius quam uelles? but this metre would be en-
tirely out of place in the present scene. I should therefore prefer the
reading secus as found in ιῐγ and all the MSS. collated by Hildyard.
Corssen connects sequius (secius, setius) with seq-nis: comp. oisc. 1v 2,
24 sed memet moror, quom Ιιοσ ayo setius.

435. For ητα-ἅπαντι and perus—cim see Introd. p. LVII.

437. fissile caput ‘a broken head? The adjective fissilis is of rare
occurrence and is in no other passage added to caput or any other part of
the human body.—The erroneous spelling capud which we here find in B,
occurs also in the old MSS. of Lucretius: see Lachmann on 111 385 p. 165,

438. Oomp. Ter. Phorm. v 8, 54 immo ut tu iam scias meam sen-
tentiam.

439. For iussero see Introd. p. xxvm. nisi iussero ‘ contrary to
my orders?

440. The prolepsis te faciam ut sis misero-umus needs no further
explanation: comp. v. 790. Examples of this kind of construction are

given by Gronovius in his note on Gellius 11 l.
442. For ita comp. v. 754. Key, L. G. § 1451 e.——Lauerna was

originally a goddess of darkness and hence naturally became the patroness
and protectress of thieves. In a fragment from Plautus' Cornicularia
quoted on v. 320 a thief prays to Laverna: comp. Hor. ep. 1 16, 60
pulcra Lauerna, Da mihi fallere, da iusto sanctoque uideri.- Noctem pec-
catis et sroeadibus obice nubem, on which passage the comm. Cruq. ob-
serves ‘ Lauerna in uia Salaria lucum habet. est autem dea- furum et
simulacrum eius fures colunt et qui consilia sua uolunt tacita, nam
preces eius cum silentio exercentur! See Preller, rom. myth. p. 218.
459. From Paulus we leam ‘ laneo-aiones fures antiqui dicebant, quod
sub tutela deae Lauernae essent, in cuius luco obscuro abditoque solitos
furta praedamque inter se luere ε’ another derivation of the name ἇπὸ

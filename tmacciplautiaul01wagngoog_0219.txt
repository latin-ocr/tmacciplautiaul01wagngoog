465. paq-acuit ‘became exasperated,’ comp. Bacch. 1099 bocboc est
quo pectus peracescit. The word does not occur elsewhere. · ’

466. Τ116 adjective manufhetarius recurs Tm‘n. 895. Olor. 444.
Bacch.. 918: 16 allusion to the last passage the word is used by Gellius
1 7. All other writers say manffesms.—‘ manifestus fur est qui in
sacievulo deprehensus est' Paullus, sene. 11 31, 2.

468. The u in mamabrium cannot be lengthened by the following
letters br, since muta cum liquida never has that effect in Plautus.
manubrium properly means a hilt or a handle, but here it assumes a
figurative sense ‘ occasion, opportunity.' Plautus has the word in only
one other passage, Epioe. 516 (Bothe) malleum sapz‘intiorem uidi ex-
cusso mdmzbrio, a line which is omitted in all our MSS. except the
Ambrosian palimpsest. ¹

469. incedit.- see note on v. 47.

47 Ο. For ausim see Key, L. G. § 482.

471 ss. Megadorus, who as a worthy old man is naturally in-
clined and en titled to criticise social nuisances and complaints, supports
in the following scene the reforming views entertained by Cato and
his political friends: see my dissertation de Aul. p. 24. There are in·
deed many allusions to the great luxury of the Roman matrons in
the Plautian comedies, and to rely on them for the chronology of these
playS, would be quite preposterous: but only two 666666 are found in ·
the 19 plays we possess, where a considerable number of verses is
exclusively devoted to this subject, and surely they cannot be considered
as merely occasional allusions, since their tendency and purpose are
openly avowed (comp. here v. 474 ss.). The one of these passages Epid.
11 2, 38-51, cannot originally have formed part of the scene in which
it stands now, as I have shown de Aul. 32 sa„ and must therefore be
left out of the question 3 but the other, i.e. the present scene in the
Aulularia, we may fairly use for placing the Aulularia after the year
560, nay we may even go further and range it among the last plays of
the poet. My friend A. Spengel at Munich, in reviewing my disser-
tation in the Eos 1865 p. 112, is disposed to attach not the slightest
importance to these arguments, an opinion shared by another reviewer
in the litterari-eche centralblatt 1864 p. 687 a: but both gentlemen do
not soem to distinguish between occasional short allusions and elabo-
rate scenes. Spengel observes ‘ auch in den framosischaen clo-amen des
voriqen jahmhundercs findet man malm-mals seitenhiebe aus den luxus des
boses, ohne dasz man dieselben als witbeetimmunq benacum Ιοόηπεο oder
die stilcke qao-ado domn entstanden wc‘z’ren, als der luoem verhciltnicmdsziq
am qrbsten war-:⁹ but unless Ι am very much mistaken, nobody would

ever call such a long 66666 as the present a ‘ side-thrust' (seitenhieb).

Now, a how of other instances is still lest. unexplained and will be
unaccounted for, unless we really admit the truth of the general law
which is found at the head of the present section. 'We cannot of
course promise to give all, or nearly all, the instances which must
hence be explained, but it will be useful to mention some prominent
examples, were it only as a brief exemplification of our law. By
diligently reading Plautian poetry, a rhythmical ear will soon become
accustomed to vthaee licences of prosody, and when once familiar with
them, the reader will not fail to discover the wonderful vivacity and
elasticity of the comic versification of the Romans, a fact which would
have been perfectly impossible, had the Latin language always been
bound by the prosodiacal fetters which, since Ennius’ time, restrained
its youthful agility and turned it into a slow, but majestic and pompous
array. Still, these words shall by no means depreciate Ennius’ merits:
for it was he who preserved the language from premature decay and
dilapidation.

We may first draw the reader’s particular attention to two little
pronouns which, on account of their frequent occurrence, were liable to
an uncertain mode of pronunciation. We mean ipse and iste .· and both
occasionally being enclitics, it was, of course, lest to the individual
liberty of the speaker, which place to assign to them in his sentence,
i. e. either to run over them by connecting them with the preceding
word, or to give them more importance by fully pronouncing their first
syllable. In the first case these pronouns would be pyrrhichs, in the
latter trochees, and accordingly they appear in Plautus and Terence in
both shapes: iste has even a secondary form ste, which was first dis·
covered by Lachmann, on Lucr. p. 197¹: in the same way we may
fairly presume the existence of an analogous form pse, though there are

no historica] documents for it ².

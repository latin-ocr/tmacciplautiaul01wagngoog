 

m'rnonno‘mon. xliii

Ϊ mm does not lengthen the first syllable in the word immo, which
Plautus himself would have spelt imo: see Mero. 737, Gaec. Ribb. Gom.-

p. 47. Ter. Phorm. v 8, 43 ¹.
πη falls under the same rulo, as the following instance shows:

1-

per annonam caram dixit me natum pater.
Stich. 179.

This is the reading of all the MSS. including the old Ambrosian ς
Ritschl has per caram annonam, in accordance with a conjecture of
Bothe.—As there was in the original pronunciation of the Romans no
difference between mm and nn ², we find the first· syllable in omnis

treated as short in several Plautian passages⁸.

pp does not differ prosodiacally from a single p in the word
Philippus, which in Plautus almost invariably appears with the Greek
accentuation Φίλιππος Pampusfi Probably, the short quantity of the
ι second syllable is to be attributed to the influence of the Greek accen-
tuation: see Key‚ Trans. of the Ph. Soc. 1855, p. 130. See also my

note on Aul. 86.
88 has the metrical value of a single 8 in the verb 8888, which must

often be read &se ⁸. The same reason explains the prosody of· dedisse
Amph. 11. 2, 130⁶, and vicissatim Stich. 532⁷.

² See Gorssen‚ ausspr. 2, 120. Ι do not think Gorssen's derivation of this word
to be right, but am unable to substitute a better one. So far as our MSS. are con-
cerned‚ the spelling immo is generally supported by better authorities than imo.

² Comp. solennis and sollemnis, and the Italian forms alanno calonna dannan·
:alumnus columna damnare,· in Italian oqni stands for anni. Gorssen‚ ausapr.

2, ξ21888 Aul. 598. Trin. 78. Other examples are found in Ritsehl’s Proll.

⁴ fiiggchl, Proll. Lunx. omn. Scaliger’s statement on the quantity of Philip·
pus ⁸ et numquam aliter inuenies apud Plautum quin mediam corripuerit’ (ad
Auson. lib. 11 21: see Dawes’ Miscellanea crit. ed. Kidd 1827 p. 154) is not

accurate.

⁸ For instances‚ see Gorssen‚ amspr. 2, 97 s.
⁶ The same prosody occurs Gist. 1 3, 24. Pseud. 893. Ritschl corrects the

passage of the Amphitruo in his Proleqomena p. cxxv, The line of the Pseudulus
should be read: m5men est :z scio idm tibi me recte dedisse epfsmlava for this is the

reading of the MSS„ the Ambrosian palimpsest not being to be relied upon in this
passage. 1 am glad to see that Fleckeisen does not follow Bitschl’s conjectures in

’ both passages.
⁷ nos potius oneremus nosmet ascissatim uoluptatibus.
⁸ This is the reading of the MSS„ recommended by the alliterationg it will no doubt‘

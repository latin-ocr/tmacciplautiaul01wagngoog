the same quantity in a line of Lucilius, if Lachmann's conjecture is
right (L. Miiller, L c.). In Juvenal we have esto (vn 79) and in
Martial reepondew (111 4, 7).

0. DROPPING OF FINAL OONSONANTS.

An accurate student of Plautian prosody will soon observe that,
for scanning Plautian verses, he must very often free himself from the
observance of the rules commonly taught under the head of positio.
N evertheless, he will at the same time see that an absolute negation
of the laws of position in Plautus would be even worse, for then we
should be at a loss to explain many cases of naturally short vowels
lengthened by position. Most, of the cases referred to will be explained
by the following remarks.

1³}ae menes of Plautus asnd Terence tcst‘tjfy a ‘qeneral tendency os the
Latin lanquaye qs their time to drop the final consonante of many words.
This tendency was not confined to the Latin alone 3 on the contrary,
we find it in most of the dialects of ancient Italy. Thus, to give a few
examples, we have uestikatu = uestiqium, srehcu = frictum, facia :faciat
in Umbrian (Corssen, aus-§pn l, 41. 46. 29) ¹.

It may be useful to premise that in many cases the Latin lan-

1 1 may add that the same process ‚has taken place in many modern languages.
E. g. a modern Greek is at liberty to say πόδι or πόδιν (= πόδιον, foot), χέριν or χέρι,
χάρι or χάρις etc„ nay in modern Greek popular poetry final consonante are very
often cut off where they ought to stand, and even added where they have no gram-
matical right to appear.—The history of the English language furnishes abundant
instances of all the same processes enumerated in this sketch of Plautian prosody:

viz. the shortening of originally lonffg vowels, the dropping of final consonants, the
entire loss of whole inflexions. 'I'he English language is, in this respect, more in-
structive than many others, because though flowing from a richly inflected language‚

it has now lost almost all its inflexione. It will, in general, be found that all the

lawsfldetailed in the present paper are by no means arbitrarily assumed for a certain
stage of the Latin language, but are in reality only special applicatione of the

‘general laws which govern the growth and decay of all forms of human speech.

152 EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY.

adds it to the following line. bona means ‘ Ι tell you true that your ques-
tion would also be my answer’ = bona fide dico me aurum non subru-

pui-see! Oomp. the next line where we should understand ‘istuc quoque
bona (fide dico me nescire). ’

768. There ought to be a comma after indipisces. The active form
of this verb occurs here and Asin. 11 2, 13, the deponent Prin. 224.
Rud. v 2, 28. Epid. 111 4, 15: see Brix on Trin. 224. The Plautian
MSS. give here inde poscere and Brix conjectures therefore that we
should write isndepiscoe, which, he says, is defended by the analogy of
depeciscor and defetiscor and attested by Festus. In later writers we
generally find adipiscor, though indipiecor occurs in Lucretius, Livy,
Gellius and Appuleius—furem eaecipere :fi recipere. Gronovius com-
pares Cic. de inp. Cn. Pomp. 9, 23 lium in illa fuya Tiyranee reoe ex-
cepit.—ita ‘yesz' comp. Ter. Andfr. v 2, 8. Key, L. G. ξ 1451 c. It is
properly a curtailed sentence ε ita aio,

769. The present fallis is here given by all our MSS. We are
however not quite sure of the true reading of this passage, which Ι have
exhibited according to the MSS. Oomp. Amph. 1 1, 235. So. quid ei

falles? ΜΕ. twm Mercurius Sosiae iratus siet. But in another passage
we have the present Amph. 111 2, 52 id eqo ei salle, tum te, summe
⁸ Iuppiter, Quaeso Amphitruoni ut semper iratus sies. In this passage
fallo means falsum dico (‘to deceive ’), and the same sense would ex-
plain the present line—For the construction me faciat (abl.) see
Key, L. G. § 1003.

774. immo has here no meaning and the hiatus cannot be justified3
perhaps we should write intus eccillam domi. immo can never have the
sense ascribed to it by Hal-e who translates ‘ To be sure, I have, her
at home3' it means (κιο, on the contrary:' see Zumpt ξ 277. Comp.

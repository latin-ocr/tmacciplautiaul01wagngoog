latus = latu 415.

maqis = mayi 419.
ullus = ullu 419.
uenimus = uem’mu 42 6.

mwribm = morilm 500.

We shall now easily understand such endings of iambica as the
following, all of which are taken from Terence’s Hecyra: affictas sit
334. defessas sum 443. incertas swm 450. expertas swm 489. πάῖἰᾶε
swm 653. aazia sit 878. comp. occidistis me Bacch. 313.

r waa in many instances, only a substitute for an older s, and
we must, therefore, be prepared to meet with the loss of a final r
likewise. Thus we have to pronounce soro (= soror) in a line from

the Poenulus (Ι 2, 84)

satis nuno lepide ornatam cred0, soror, te tibi uiderier.

and in two short anapaestic lines from the Stichus (18 and 20):

haec res Ι uitae (ωε, soror, Ι saturant -—
ne lacrulma, soror, Ι neu tsio id Ι animo—

Another line in the same ’play furnishes a fourth exainple of the same
pronunciation (v. 68):

quid agimus, soror, si offirmabit peter aduorsum nos ει pati —

In Terence we have the same, Eun. 1 2, 77

soror dictast ι cupio abducere, ut reddam suis.

This is the reading of the Bembine MS„ and the prosody of -soro obict-
was already rightly explained by Faernus in his note on the passage ¹,
but in Parry’s edition we find the reading of some late MSS. soror eet
dicta in the text. I cannot understand such inconsistency, since Parry
himself aHows a ‘ contracted' pronunciation for soror (Introd. xnvl).

¹ Liber Bembinus quocum hic consentiunt omnes fere libri recentes—nec uersus
repugnat, si abicias r ex soror, ut primus pes sit anapaestus. FAERNVS.—If we
adopt Corssen’s views (krit. beitr. zur lat. formenlehre, p. 399 8.), we should have to
acknowledge the possible dropping of a final r only in those words where it had
supplanted an original s. The sole exception to this law would be pater, and this
instance has been neglected by Corssen.

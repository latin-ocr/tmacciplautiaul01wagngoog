. D. SHORTENING OF OTHER. LONG ENDINGS.

It will be found that final syllables in which the vowel was long by
nature were not shortcned by the sole influence of the accent, unless
the words to which they belonged were originally iambs¹. We have
yet to mention that the same shortening process affected even such
endings as would seem to oppose the strongest· resistance to every
attempt to shorten them: ᾶε δε Es is τῖε, and sometimes not only are the
vowels of these endings shortened‚ but even the final consonants dropt.
Some instances will serve to exemplify this observation. ¹ ·

1. Thus the ending Cis appears shortened in bonassoras myas:

bonas 111 aecumst facere, facitis
Stich. 99.

foras, foras, lumbrice...
Aul. 620². ,

quid, foras? foras hercle 11616
Stich. 597.

ipse abiit foras, me reliquit
Poen. v 5, 4.

1611 negas Tyndarum esse? 2: nego inquam 2: tfin te Philocratem esse ais?
Gapt. 111 4, 39.

sic sine igitur, si tuom negas me esse, abire liberum
Men. 1028.

In the last two 1661611666, we giv‘e the reading of the MSS. which

has been altered by Bitschl, Pron. Trin- CXLVIII. In the line from the
Captivi 1116 accentuation Tyndarum, which in accordance with Ritschl

1 Exceptions to this 11116 would be adtuli occidi and imma. But the first may
be explained from tuli, and iussero follows the analogy 'of the short o of the present.
occidi occurs in an anapaestic line, 1. 6. in so-called ‘free’ metre. smwtra (p. xxiii)
is quite isolated.—With regard to the dropping of final consonante, we have to
modify our statement. s and m were indeed so frequently dropt that the prosody
of the antepenult cannot be considered 16 1111111 the extension of this licence. But
in all other cases the law given above would apply 16 1116 dropping of final conso-
nants just as well. See our remarks 611 pater and mater p. xxxiii.

² I quote Taubmann’s 11616 611 11116 passage, simply to show that his view 611116
fact in question was quite correct. ‘ Critici posteriores non admisere, quod igno-

rarent foras utranque syllabam habere breuem: 111 liquet uel ex Poen. v 5, 4.
Stich. tv 2, 1 ὡ tv 4, 55: '

(2) J, a manuscript¹ in the British Museum, formerly belonging to
the King’s Library3 it still bears the mark 15 O xl with which it is
mentioned in Oasley's ‘Catalogue of the ⁸Manuscr'ipts of the King’s
Library' (London 17 34) p. 243. The ΜΒ. being as yet almost entirely
unknown, I will here give a full account of its present state and its
bearing on Plautian criticism.

The ΜΒ. 15 O x1 contains first of all the Tusculan questions written
in a hand of the tenth or eleventh century. The first leaf being want-
ing, it commences with 1 4, 7 ornateque dicere. With folio 30⁸ quite
another hand begins which continues to the end of the Tusculana, fol.
58¹² ς fol. 58¹· is left blank 3 fol. 59⁸ Cicero de inuentione rhetorica begins
written in a hand of the 13th century. Here, each page is divided into
two columns 3 and the same continues in the Rhetorica ad Herennium,
which commences fol. 86². Alter the words ‘ ec hic liber non parum
continet litterar que restat in reliquis dicem9’ follows immediately in the
same handwriting ‘Ecsi neqociis familiarib9 impediti uixsatis ocium
studio subpeditare possum9’ etc. It ends fol. 112¹) ‘hec ὀἵα adipiscemur
ei raes pceptb‘nis diliqentia consequemur ὠ exercitatione. Explicit?

Here the Plautian ΜΒ. begins, The general character of the
handwriting is that of the end of 1110 eleventh century, but perhaps it
may be attributed with just as much reason to the commencement of
the twelfth. The ΜΒ. 18 111 a deplorable condition. In the corners
of the pages the writing has totally disappeared3 very osten it is quite
impossible to read either the commencement or the end of whole lines}
some leaveS, especially the first, are almost entirely destroyed. But
this can be better seen in the Amphitruo than in the Aulularia, which
has not suffered so much as other parts of the ΜΒ. Ι should have been
inclined to think that the ΜΒ. was thus lamentably damaged by the
great fire which destroyed a part of the King’s Library in the year
17 33, had it not been for Casley's observation ‘lacerata eunt aliqua folia
in principio codicie' and p. 316, where he mentions the damages caused
by the late fire, he expressly states that the ΜΒ. was ‘ preserved,’ with-
out adding any further observation. Moreover, the different ΜΒΒ. now
